 * SECTION: WebKitMemoryPressureSettings
 * @Short_description: A boxed type representing the settings for the MemoryPressureHandler
 * @Title: WebKitMemoryPressureSettings
 * @See_also: #WebKitWebContext.
 *
 * #WebKitMemoryPressureSettings is a boxed type that can be used to provide some custom settings
 * to control how the memory pressure situations are handled by the different processes.
 *
 * The memory pressure system implemented inside the different process will try to keep the memory usage
 * under the defined memory limit. In order to do that, it will check the used memory with a user defined
 * frequency and decide whether it should try to release memory. The thresholds passed will define how urgent
 * is to release that memory.
 *
 * Take into account that badly defined parameters can greatly reduce the performance of the engine. For
 * example, setting memory limit too low with a fast poll interval can cause the process to constantly
 * be trying to release memory.
 *
 * A #WebKitMemoryPressureSettings can be passed to a #WebKitWebContext constructor, and the settings will
 * be applied to all the web processes created by that context.
 *
 * Since: 2.34
