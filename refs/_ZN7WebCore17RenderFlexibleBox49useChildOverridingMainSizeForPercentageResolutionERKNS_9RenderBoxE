<doc f='WebKit/Source/WebCore/rendering/RenderFlexibleBox.cpp' l='1323'>// This method is only called whenever a descendant of a flex item wants to resolve a percentage in its
// block axis (logical height). The key here is that percentages should be generally resolved before the
// flex item is flexed, meaning that they shouldn&apos;t be recomputed once the flex item has been flexed. There
// are some exceptions though that are implemented here, like the case of fully inflexible items with
// definite flex-basis, or whenever the flex container has a definite main size. See
// https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#definite-sizes for additional details.</doc>
