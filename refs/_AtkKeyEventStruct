 * AtkKeyEventStruct:
 * @type: An AtkKeyEventType, generally one of ATK_KEY_EVENT_PRESS or ATK_KEY_EVENT_RELEASE
 * @state: A bitmask representing the state of the modifier keys immediately after the event takes place.   
 * The meaning of the bits is currently defined to match the bitmask used by GDK in
 * GdkEventType.state, see 
 * http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gdk/gdk-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventKey
 * @keyval: A guint representing a keysym value corresponding to those used by GDK and X11: see
 * /usr/X11/include/keysymdef.h.
 * @length: The length of member #string.
 * @string: A string containing one of the following: either a string approximating the text that would 
 * result from this keypress, if the key is a control or graphic character, or a symbolic name for this keypress.
 * Alphanumeric and printable keys will have the symbolic key name in this string member, for instance &quot;A&quot;. &quot;0&quot;, 
 * &quot;semicolon&quot;, &quot;aacute&quot;.  Keypad keys have the prefix &quot;KP&quot;.
 * @keycode: The raw hardware code that generated the key event.  This field is raraly useful.
 * @timestamp: A timestamp in milliseconds indicating when the event occurred.  
 * These timestamps are relative to a starting point which should be considered arbitrary, 
 * and only used to compare the dispatch times of events to one another.
 *
 * Encapsulates information about a key event.
