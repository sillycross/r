 * GstAudioMeta:
 * @meta: parent #GstMeta
 * @info: the audio properties of the buffer
 * @samples: the number of valid samples in the buffer
 * @offsets: the offsets (in bytes) where each channel plane starts in the
 *   buffer or %NULL if the buffer has interleaved layout; if not %NULL, this
 *   is guaranteed to be an array of @info.channels elements
 *
 * Buffer metadata describing how data is laid out inside the buffer. This
 * is useful for non-interleaved (planar) buffers, where it is necessary to
 * have a place to store where each plane starts and how long each plane is.
 *
 * It is a requirement for non-interleaved buffers to have this metadata
 * attached and to be mapped with gst_audio_buffer_map() in order to ensure
 * correct handling of clipping and channel reordering.
 *
 * The different channels in @offsets are always in the GStreamer channel order.
 * Zero-copy channel reordering can be implemented by swapping the values in
 * @offsets.
 *
 * It is not allowed for channels to overlap in memory,
 * i.e. for each i in [0, channels), the range
 * [@offsets[i], @offsets[i] + @samples * sample_stride) must not overlap
 * with any other such range.
 *
 * It is, however, allowed to have parts of the buffer memory unused,
 * by using @offsets and @samples in such a way that leave gaps on it.
 * This is used to implement zero-copy clipping in non-interleaved buffers.
 *
 * Obviously, due to the above, it is not safe to infer the
 * number of valid samples from the size of the buffer. You should always
 * use the @samples variable of this metadata.
 *
 * Note that for interleaved audio it is not a requirement to have this
 * metadata attached and at the moment of writing, there is actually no use
 * case to do so. It is, however, allowed to attach it, for some potential
 * future use case.
 *
 * Since: 1.16
