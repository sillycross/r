<doc f='WebKit/Source/WebCore/dom/Document.cpp' l='393'>// DOM Level 2 says (letters added):
//
// a) Name start characters must have one of the categories Ll, Lu, Lo, Lt, Nl.
// b) Name characters other than Name-start characters must have one of the categories Mc, Me, Mn, Lm, or Nd.
// c) Characters in the compatibility area (i.e. with character code greater than #xF900 and less than #xFFFE) are not allowed in XML names.
// d) Characters which have a font or compatibility decomposition (i.e. those with a &quot;compatibility formatting tag&quot; in field 5 of the database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a &quot;&lt;&quot;) are not allowed.
// e) The following characters are treated as name-start characters rather than name characters, because the property file classifies them as Alphabetic: [#x02BB-#x02C1], #x0559, #x06E5, #x06E6.
// f) Characters #x20DD-#x20E0 are excluded (in accordance with Unicode, section 5.14).
// g) Character #x00B7 is classified as an extender, because the property list so identifies it.
// h) Character #x0387 is added as a name character, because #x00B7 is its canonical equivalent.
// i) Characters &apos;:&apos; and &apos;_&apos; are allowed as name-start characters.
// j) Characters &apos;-&apos; and &apos;.&apos; are allowed as name characters.
//
// It also contains complete tables. If we decide it&apos;s better, we could include those instead of the following code.</doc>
