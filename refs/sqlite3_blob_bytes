** CAPI3REF: Return The Size Of An Open BLOB
** METHOD: sqlite3_blob
**
** ^Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the 
** successfully opened [BLOB handle] in its only argument.  ^The
** incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing
** blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.
**
** This routine only works on a [BLOB handle] which has been created
** by a prior successful call to [sqlite3_blob_open()] and which has not
** been closed by [sqlite3_blob_close()].  Passing any other pointer in
** to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
