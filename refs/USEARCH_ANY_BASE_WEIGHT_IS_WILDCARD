     * Value for USEARCH_ELEMENT_COMPARISON.
     * collation element comparison is modified to effectively provide
     * behavior between the specified strength and strength - 1. Collation
     * elements in either the pattern or the searched text that have the
     * base weight for the specified strength are treated as &quot;wildcards&quot;
     * that match an element with any other weight at that collation level.
     * For example, with a secondary-strength English collator, a plain &apos;e&apos;
     * in the pattern will match a plain e or an e with any diacritic in the
     * searched text, but an e with diacritic in the pattern will only
     * match an e with the same diacritic or a plain e in the searched text.
     *
     * This option is similar to &quot;asymmetric search&quot; as described in
     * [UTS #10 Unicode Collation Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Asymmetric_Search),
     * but also allows unmarked characters in the searched text to match
     * marked or unmarked versions of that character in the pattern.
