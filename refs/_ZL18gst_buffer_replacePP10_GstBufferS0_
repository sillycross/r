 * gst_buffer_replace:
 * @obuf: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a pointer to
 *     a #GstBuffer to be replaced.
 * @nbuf: (transfer none) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstBuffer that will
 *     replace the buffer pointed to by @obuf.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstBuffer to point to a different #GstBuffer. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread safety
 * in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately (the old
 * buffer is unreffed, the new is reffed).
 *
 * Either @nbuf or the #GstBuffer pointed to by @obuf may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE when @obuf was different from @nbuf.
