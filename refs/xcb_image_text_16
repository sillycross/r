 * @brief Draws text
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param string_len The length of the \a string in characters. Note that this parameter limited by
 * 255 due to using 8 bits!
 * @param drawable The drawable (Window or Pixmap) to draw text on.
 * @param gc The graphics context to use.
 * \n
 * The following graphics context components are used: plane-mask, foreground,
 * background, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
 * @param x The x coordinate of the first character, relative to the origin of \a drawable.
 * @param y The y coordinate of the first character, relative to the origin of \a drawable.
 * @param string The string to draw. Only the first 255 characters are relevant due to the data
 * type of \a string_len. Every character uses 2 bytes (hence the 16 in this
 * request&apos;s name).
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Fills the destination rectangle with the background pixel from \a gc, then
 * paints the text with the foreground pixel from \a gc. The upper-left corner of
 * the filled rectangle is at [x, y - font-ascent]. The width is overall-width,
 * the height is font-ascent + font-descent. The overall-width, font-ascent and
 * font-descent are as returned by `xcb_query_text_extents` (TODO).
 * 
 * Note that using X core fonts is deprecated (but still supported) in favor of
 * client-side rendering using Xft.
