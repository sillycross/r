 * hb_feature_t:
 * @tag: a feature tag
 * @value: 0 disables the feature, non-zero (usually 1) enables the feature.
 * For features implemented as lookup type 3 (like &apos;salt&apos;) the @value is a one
 * based index into the alternates.
 * @start: the cluster to start applying this feature setting (inclusive).
 * @end: the cluster to end applying this feature setting (exclusive).
 *
 * The #hb_feature_t is the structure that holds information about requested
 * feature application. The feature will be applied with the given value to all
 * glyphs which are in clusters between @start (inclusive) and @end (exclusive).
 * Setting start to @HB_FEATURE_GLOBAL_START and end to @HB_FEATURE_GLOBAL_END
 * specifies that the feature always applies to the entire buffer.
