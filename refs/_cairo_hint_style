 * cairo_hint_style_t:
 * @CAIRO_HINT_STYLE_DEFAULT: Use the default hint style for
 *   font backend and target device, since 1.0
 * @CAIRO_HINT_STYLE_NONE: Do not hint outlines, since 1.0
 * @CAIRO_HINT_STYLE_SLIGHT: Hint outlines slightly to improve
 *   contrast while retaining good fidelity to the original
 *   shapes, since 1.0
 * @CAIRO_HINT_STYLE_MEDIUM: Hint outlines with medium strength
 *   giving a compromise between fidelity to the original shapes
 *   and contrast, since 1.0
 * @CAIRO_HINT_STYLE_FULL: Hint outlines to maximize contrast, since 1.0
 *
 * Specifies the type of hinting to do on font outlines. Hinting
 * is the process of fitting outlines to the pixel grid in order
 * to improve the appearance of the result. Since hinting outlines
 * involves distorting them, it also reduces the faithfulness
 * to the original outline shapes. Not all of the outline hinting
 * styles are supported by all font backends.
 *
 * New entries may be added in future versions.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
