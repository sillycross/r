 * @ingroup iface_wl_subsurface
 *
 * Change the commit behaviour of the sub-surface to desynchronized
 * mode, also described as independent or freely running mode.
 *
 * In desynchronized mode, wl_surface.commit on a sub-surface will
 * apply the pending state directly, without caching, as happens
 * normally with a wl_surface. Calling wl_surface.commit on the
 * parent surface has no effect on the sub-surface&apos;s wl_surface
 * state. This mode allows a sub-surface to be updated on its own.
 *
 * If cached state exists when wl_surface.commit is called in
 * desynchronized mode, the pending state is added to the cached
 * state, and applied as a whole. This invalidates the cache.
 *
 * Note: even if a sub-surface is set to desynchronized, a parent
 * sub-surface may override it to behave as synchronized. For details,
 * see wl_subsurface.
 *
 * If a surface&apos;s parent surface behaves as desynchronized, then
 * the cached state is applied on set_desync.
