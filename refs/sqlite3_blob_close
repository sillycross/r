** CAPI3REF: Close A BLOB Handle
** DESTRUCTOR: sqlite3_blob
**
** ^This function closes an open [BLOB handle]. ^(The BLOB handle is closed
** unconditionally.  Even if this routine returns an error code, the 
** handle is still closed.)^
**
** ^If the blob handle being closed was opened for read-write access, and if
** the database is in auto-commit mode and there are no other open read-write
** blob handles or active write statements, the current transaction is
** committed. ^If an error occurs while committing the transaction, an error
** code is returned and the transaction rolled back.
**
** Calling this function with an argument that is not a NULL pointer or an
** open blob handle results in undefined behaviour. ^Calling this routine 
** with a null pointer (such as would be returned by a failed call to 
** [sqlite3_blob_open()]) is a harmless no-op. ^Otherwise, if this function
** is passed a valid open blob handle, the values returned by the 
** sqlite3_errcode() and sqlite3_errmsg() functions are set before returning.
