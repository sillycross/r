** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocator Statistics
**
** SQLite provides these two interfaces for reporting on the status
** of the [sqlite3_malloc()], [sqlite3_free()], and [sqlite3_realloc()]
** routines, which form the built-in memory allocation subsystem.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_memory_used()] routine returns the number of bytes
** of memory currently outstanding (malloced but not freed).
** ^The [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] routine returns the maximum
** value of [sqlite3_memory_used()] since the high-water mark
** was last reset.  ^The values returned by [sqlite3_memory_used()] and
** [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] include any overhead
** added by SQLite in its implementation of [sqlite3_malloc()],
** but not overhead added by the any underlying system library
** routines that [sqlite3_malloc()] may call.
**
** ^The memory high-water mark is reset to the current value of
** [sqlite3_memory_used()] if and only if the parameter to
** [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] is true.  ^The value returned
** by [sqlite3_memory_highwater(1)] is the high-water mark
** prior to the reset.
