 * gst_buffer_list_take:
 * @old_list: (inout) (transfer full): pointer to a pointer to a #GstBufferList
 *     to be replaced.
 * @new_list: (transfer full) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstBufferList
 *     that will replace the bufferlist pointed to by @old_list.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstBufferList to point to a different
 * #GstBufferList. This function is similar to gst_buffer_list_replace() except
 * that it takes ownership of @new_list.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_list was different from @old_list
 *
 * Since: 1.16
