<doc f='include/xcb/xproto.h' l='3045'>/**&lt; The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:
Solid                The full path of the line is drawn.
DoubleDash           The full path of the line is drawn, but the even dashes are filled differently
                     than the odd dashes (see fill-style), with Butt cap-style used where even and
                     odd dashes meet.
OnOffDash            Only the even dashes are drawn, and cap-style applies to all internal ends of
                     the individual dashes (except NotLast is treated as Butt). */</doc>
