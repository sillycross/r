 * @ingroup iface_wl_display
 *
 * The sync request asks the server to emit the &apos;done&apos; event
 * on the returned wl_callback object.  Since requests are
 * handled in-order and events are delivered in-order, this can
 * be used as a barrier to ensure all previous requests and the
 * resulting events have been handled.
 *
 * The object returned by this request will be destroyed by the
 * compositor after the callback is fired and as such the client must not
 * attempt to use it after that point.
 *
 * The callback_data passed in the callback is the event serial.
