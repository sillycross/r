** CAPI3REF: Determine If Virtual Table Column Access Is For UPDATE
**
** If the sqlite3_vtab_nochange(X) routine is called within the [xColumn]
** method of a [virtual table], then it returns true if and only if the
** column is being fetched as part of an UPDATE operation during which the
** column value will not change.  Applications might use this to substitute
** a return value that is less expensive to compute and that the corresponding
** [xUpdate] method understands as a &quot;no-change&quot; value.
**
** If the [xColumn] method calls sqlite3_vtab_nochange() and finds that
** the column is not changed by the UPDATE statement, then the xColumn
** method can optionally return without setting a result, without calling
** any of the [sqlite3_result_int|sqlite3_result_xxxxx() interfaces].
** In that case, [sqlite3_value_nochange(X)] will return true for the
** same column in the [xUpdate] method.
