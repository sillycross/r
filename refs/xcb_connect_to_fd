 * @brief Connects to the X server.
 * @param fd The file descriptor.
 * @param auth_info Authentication data.
 * @return A newly allocated xcb_connection_t structure.
 *
 * Connects to an X server, given the open socket @p fd and the
 * xcb_auth_info_t @p auth_info. The file descriptor @p fd is
 * bidirectionally connected to an X server. If the connection
 * should be unauthenticated, @p auth_info must be @c
 * NULL.
 *
 * Always returns a non-NULL pointer to a xcb_connection_t, even on failure.
 * Callers need to use xcb_connection_has_error() to check for failure.
 * When finished, use xcb_disconnect() to close the connection and free
 * the structure.
