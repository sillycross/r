 * This request creates a registry object that allows the client
 * to list and bind the global objects available from the
 * compositor.
 *
 * It should be noted that the server side resources consumed in
 * response to a get_registry request can only be released when the
 * client disconnects, not when the client side proxy is destroyed.
 * Therefore, clients should invoke get_registry as infrequently as
 * possible to avoid wasting memory.
