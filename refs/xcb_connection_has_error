 * @brief Test whether the connection has shut down due to a fatal error.
 * @param c The connection.
 * @return &gt; 0 if the connection is in an error state; 0 otherwise.
 *
 * Some errors that occur in the context of an xcb_connection_t
 * are unrecoverable. When such an error occurs, the
 * connection is shut down and further operations on the
 * xcb_connection_t have no effect, but memory will not be freed until
 * xcb_disconnect() is called on the xcb_connection_t.
 *
 * @return XCB_CONN_ERROR, because of socket errors, pipe errors or other stream errors.
 * @return XCB_CONN_CLOSED_EXT_NOTSUPPORTED, when extension not supported.
 * @return XCB_CONN_CLOSED_MEM_INSUFFICIENT, when memory not available.
 * @return XCB_CONN_CLOSED_REQ_LEN_EXCEED, exceeding request length that server accepts.
 * @return XCB_CONN_CLOSED_PARSE_ERR, error during parsing display string.
 * @return XCB_CONN_CLOSED_INVALID_SCREEN, because the server does not have a screen matching the display.
