<doc f='WebKit/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer/mse/TrackQueue.h' l='66'>// The point of having a queue for WebKitMediaSource is to limit the number of context switches per second.
    // If we had no queue, the main thread would have to be awaken for every frame. On the other hand, if the
    // queue had unlimited size WebKit would end up requesting flushes more often than necessary when frames
    // in the future are re-appended. As a sweet spot between these extremes we choose to allow enqueueing a
    // few seconds worth of samples.

    // `isReadyForMoreSamples` follows the classical two water levels strategy: initially it&apos;s true until the
    // high water level is reached, then it becomes false until the queue drains down to the low water level
    // and the cycle repeats. This way we avoid stalls and minimize context switches.</doc>
