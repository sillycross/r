<doc f='WebKit/WTF/Headers/wtf/glib/RunLoopSourcePriority.h' l='28'>// This is a global enum to define priorities used by GLib run loop sources.
// In GLib, priorities are represented by an integer where lower values mean
// higher priority. The following macros are defined in GLib:
// G_PRIORITY_LOW = 300
// G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE = 200
// G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE = 100
// G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT = 0
// G_PRIORITY_HIGH = -100
// We don&apos;t use those macros here to avoid having to include glib header only
// for this. But we should take into account that GLib uses G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
// for timeout sources and G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE for idle sources.
// Changes in these priorities can have a huge impact in performance, and in
// the correctness too, so be careful when changing them.</doc>
