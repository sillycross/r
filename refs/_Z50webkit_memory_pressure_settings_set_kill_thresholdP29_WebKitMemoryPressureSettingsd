 *
 * Sets @value as the fraction of the defined memory limit where the process will be
 * killed.
 *
 * The threshold must be a value bigger or equal to 0. A value of 0 means that the process
 * is never killed. If the threshold is not 0, then it must be bigger than the strict threshold
 * defined in @settings. The threshold can also have values bigger than 1. The default value is 0.
