 * @ingroup iface_wl_shm_pool
 *
 * Create a wl_buffer object from the pool.
 *
 * The buffer is created offset bytes into the pool and has
 * width and height as specified.  The stride argument specifies
 * the number of bytes from the beginning of one row to the beginning
 * of the next.  The format is the pixel format of the buffer and
 * must be one of those advertised through the wl_shm.format event.
 *
 * A buffer will keep a reference to the pool it was created from
 * so it is valid to destroy the pool immediately after creating
 * a buffer from it.
