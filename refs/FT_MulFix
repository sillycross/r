   * @function:
   *   FT_MulFix
   *
   * @description:
   *   Compute `(a*b)/0x10000` with maximum accuracy.  Its main use is to
   *   multiply a given value by a 16.16 fixed-point factor.
   *
   * @input:
   *   a ::
   *     The first multiplier.
   *
   *   b ::
   *     The second multiplier.  Use a 16.16 factor here whenever possible
   *     (see note below).
   *
   * @return:
   *   The result of `(a*b)/0x10000`.
   *
   * @note:
   *   This function has been optimized for the case where the absolute value
   *   of `a` is less than 2048, and `b` is a 16.16 scaling factor.  As this
   *   happens mainly when scaling from notional units to fractional pixels
   *   in FreeType, it resulted in noticeable speed improvements between
   *   versions 2.x and 1.x.
   *
   *   As a conclusion, always try to place a 16.16 factor as the _second_
   *   argument of this function; this can make a great difference.
