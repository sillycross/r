   * @function:
   *   FT_Set_Transform
   *
   * @description:
   *   Set the transformation that is applied to glyph images when they are
   *   loaded into a glyph slot through @FT_Load_Glyph.
   *
   * @inout:
   *   face ::
   *     A handle to the source face object.
   *
   * @input:
   *   matrix ::
   *     A pointer to the transformation&apos;s 2x2 matrix.  Use `NULL` for the
   *     identity matrix.
   *   delta ::
   *     A pointer to the translation vector.  Use `NULL` for the null vector.
   *
   * @note:
   *   The transformation is only applied to scalable image formats after the
   *   glyph has been loaded.  It means that hinting is unaltered by the
   *   transformation and is performed on the character size given in the
   *   last call to @FT_Set_Char_Size or @FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes.
   *
   *   Note that this also transforms the `face.glyph.advance` field, but
   *   **not** the values in `face.glyph.metrics`.
