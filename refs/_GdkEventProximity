 * GdkEventProximity:
 * @type: the type of the event (%GDK_PROXIMITY_IN or %GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT).
 * @window: the window which received the event.
 * @send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.
 * @time: the time of the event in milliseconds.
 * @device: the master device that the event originated from. Use
 * gdk_event_get_source_device() to get the slave device.
 *
 * Proximity events are generated when using GDK’s wrapper for the
 * XInput extension. The XInput extension is an add-on for standard X
 * that allows you to use nonstandard devices such as graphics tablets.
 * A proximity event indicates that the stylus has moved in or out of
 * contact with the tablet, or perhaps that the user’s finger has moved
 * in or out of contact with a touch screen.
 *
 * This event type will be used pretty rarely. It only is important for
 * XInput aware programs that are drawing their own cursor.
