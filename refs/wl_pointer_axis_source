 * @ingroup iface_wl_pointer
 * axis source types
 *
 * Describes the source types for axis events. This indicates to the
 * client how an axis event was physically generated; a client may
 * adjust the user interface accordingly. For example, scroll events
 * from a &quot;finger&quot; source may be in a smooth coordinate space with
 * kinetic scrolling whereas a &quot;wheel&quot; source may be in discrete steps
 * of a number of lines.
 *
 * The &quot;continuous&quot; axis source is a device generating events in a
 * continuous coordinate space, but using something other than a
 * finger. One example for this source is button-based scrolling where
 * the vertical motion of a device is converted to scroll events while
 * a button is held down.
 *
 * The &quot;wheel tilt&quot; axis source indicates that the actual device is a
 * wheel but the scroll event is not caused by a rotation but a
 * (usually sideways) tilt of the wheel.
