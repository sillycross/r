@typedef JSObjectHasPropertyCallback
@abstract The callback invoked when determining whether an object has a property.
@param ctx The execution context to use.
@param object The JSObject to search for the property.
@param propertyName A JSString containing the name of the property look up.
@result true if object has the property, otherwise false.
@discussion If you named your function HasProperty, you would declare it like this:

bool HasProperty(JSContextRef ctx, JSObjectRef object, JSStringRef propertyName);

If this function returns false, the hasProperty request forwards to object&apos;s statically declared properties, then its parent class chain (which includes the default object class), then its prototype chain.

This callback enables optimization in cases where only a property&apos;s existence needs to be known, not its value, and computing its value would be expensive.

If this callback is NULL, the getProperty callback will be used to service hasProperty requests.
