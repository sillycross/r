@typedef JSObjectDeletePropertyCallback
@abstract The callback invoked when deleting a property.
@param ctx The execution context to use.
@param object The JSObject in which to delete the property.
@param propertyName A JSString containing the name of the property to delete.
@param exception A pointer to a JSValueRef in which to return an exception, if any.
@result true if propertyName was successfully deleted, otherwise false.
@discussion If you named your function DeleteProperty, you would declare it like this:

bool DeleteProperty(JSContextRef ctx, JSObjectRef object, JSStringRef propertyName, JSValueRef* exception);

If this function returns false, the delete request forwards to object&apos;s statically declared properties, then its parent class chain (which includes the default object class).
