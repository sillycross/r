 * @brief Grab pointer button(s)
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param owner_events If 1, the \a grab_window will still get the pointer events. If 0, events are not
 * reported to the \a grab_window.
 * @param grab_window Specifies the window on which the pointer should be grabbed.
 * @param event_mask Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.
 * \n
 * TODO: which values?
 * @param pointer_mode A bitmask of #xcb_grab_mode_t values.
 * @param pointer_mode \n
 * @param keyboard_mode A bitmask of #xcb_grab_mode_t values.
 * @param keyboard_mode \n
 * @param confine_to Specifies the window to confine the pointer in (the user will not be able to
 * move the pointer out of that window).
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_NONE` means don&apos;t confine the pointer.
 * @param cursor Specifies the cursor that should be displayed or `XCB_NONE` to not change the
 * cursor.
 * @param button A bitmask of #xcb_button_index_t values.
 * @param button \n
 * @param modifiers The modifiers to grab.
 * \n
 * Using the special value `XCB_MOD_MASK_ANY` means grab the pointer with all
 * possible modifier combinations.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * This request establishes a passive grab. The pointer is actively grabbed as
 * described in GrabPointer, the last-pointer-grab time is set to the time at
 * which the button was pressed (as transmitted in the ButtonPress event), and the
 * ButtonPress event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:
 * 
 * The pointer is not grabbed and the specified button is logically pressed when
 * the specified modifier keys are logically down, and no other buttons or
 * modifier keys are logically down.
 * 
 * The grab-window contains the pointer.
 * 
 * The confine-to window (if any) is viewable.
 * 
 * A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist on any
 * ancestor of grab-window.
 * 
 * The interpretation of the remaining arguments is the same as for GrabPointer.
 * The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
 * pointer has all buttons released, independent of the logical state of modifier
 * keys. Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of the
 * protocol) may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen. This
 * request overrides all previous passive grabs by the same client on the same
 * button/key combinations on the same window. A modifier of AnyModifier is
 * equivalent to issuing the request for all possible modifier combinations
 * (including the combination of no modifiers). It is not required that all
 * specified modifiers have currently assigned keycodes. A button of AnyButton is
 * equivalent to issuing the request for all possible buttons. Otherwise, it is
 * not required that the button specified currently be assigned to a physical
 * button.
 * 
 * An Access error is generated if some other client has already issued a
 * GrabButton request with the same button/key combination on the same window.
 * When using AnyModifier or AnyButton, the request fails completely (no grabs are
 * established), and an Access error is generated if there is a conflicting grab
 * for any combination. The request has no effect on an active grab.
