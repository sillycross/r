 * All possible field categories in ICU. Every entry in this enum corresponds
 * to another enum that exists in ICU.
 * 
 * In the APIs that take a UFieldCategory, an int32_t type is used. Field
 * categories having any of the top four bits turned on are reserved as
 * private-use for external APIs implementing FormattedValue. This means that
 * categories 2^28 and higher or below zero (with the highest bit turned on)
 * are private-use and will not be used by ICU in the future.
