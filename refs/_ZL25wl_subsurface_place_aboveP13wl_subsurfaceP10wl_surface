 * @ingroup iface_wl_subsurface
 *
 * This sub-surface is taken from the stack, and put back just
 * above the reference surface, changing the z-order of the sub-surfaces.
 * The reference surface must be one of the sibling surfaces, or the
 * parent surface. Using any other surface, including this sub-surface,
 * will cause a protocol error.
 *
 * The z-order is double-buffered. Requests are handled in order and
 * applied immediately to a pending state. The final pending state is
 * copied to the active state the next time the state of the parent
 * surface is applied. When this happens depends on whether the parent
 * surface is in synchronized mode or not. See wl_subsurface.set_sync and
 * wl_subsurface.set_desync for details.
 *
 * A new sub-surface is initially added as the top-most in the stack
 * of its siblings and parent.
