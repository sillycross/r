 * webkit_web_context_set_process_model:
 * @context: the #WebKitWebContext
 * @process_model: a #WebKitProcessModel
 *
 * Specifies a process model for WebViews, which WebKit will use to
 * determine how auxiliary processes are handled.
 *
 * %WEBKIT_PROCESS_MODEL_MULTIPLE_SECONDARY_PROCESSES will use
 * one process per view most of the time, while still allowing for web
 * views to share a process when needed (for example when different
 * views interact with each other). Using this model, when a process
 * hangs or crashes, only the WebViews using it stop working, while
 * the rest of the WebViews in the application will still function
 * normally.
 *
 * %WEBKIT_PROCESS_MODEL_SHARED_SECONDARY_PROCESS is deprecated since 2.26,
 * using it has no effect for security reasons.
 *
 * This method **must be called before any web process has been created**,
 * as early as possible in your application. Calling it later will make
 * your application crash.
 *
 * Since: 2.4
