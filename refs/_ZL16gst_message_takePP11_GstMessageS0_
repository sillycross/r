 * gst_message_take:
 * @old_message: (inout) (transfer full): pointer to a pointer to a #GstMessage
 *     to be replaced.
 * @new_message: (transfer full) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstMessage that
 *     will replace the message pointed to by @old_message.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstMessage to point to a different #GstMessage. This
 * function is similar to gst_message_replace() except that it takes ownership
 * of @new_message.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_message was different from @old_message
 *
 * Since: 1.16
