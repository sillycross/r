 * @brief Creates a window
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param depth Specifies the new window&apos;s depth (TODO: what unit?).
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT` means the depth is taken from the
 * \a parent window.
 * @param wid The ID with which you will refer to the new window, created by
 * `xcb_generate_id`.
 * @param parent The parent window of the new window.
 * @param x The X coordinate of the new window.
 * @param y The Y coordinate of the new window.
 * @param width The width of the new window.
 * @param height The height of the new window.
 * @param border_width TODO:
 * \n
 * Must be zero if the `class` is `InputOnly` or a `xcb_match_error_t` occurs.
 * @param _class A bitmask of #xcb_window_class_t values.
 * @param _class \n
 * @param visual Specifies the id for the new window&apos;s visual.
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT` means the visual is taken from the
 * \a parent window.
 * @param value_mask A bitmask of #xcb_cw_t values.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Creates an unmapped window as child of the specified \a parent window. A
 * CreateNotify event will be generated. The new window is placed on top in the
 * stacking order with respect to siblings.
 * 
 * The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical with
 * the origin [0, 0] at the upper-left corner. Coordinates are integral, in terms
 * of pixels, and coincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap has its own
 * coordinate system. For a window, the origin is inside the border at the inside,
 * upper-left corner.
 * 
 * The created window is not yet displayed (mapped), call `xcb_map_window` to
 * display it.
 * 
 * The created window will initially use the same cursor as its parent.
