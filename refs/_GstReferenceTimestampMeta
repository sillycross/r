 * GstReferenceTimestampMeta:
 * @parent: the parent #GstMeta structure
 * @reference: identifier for the timestamp reference.
 * @timestamp: timestamp
 * @duration: duration, or %GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE
 *
 * #GstReferenceTimestampMeta can be used to attach alternative timestamps and
 * possibly durations to a #GstBuffer. These are generally not according to
 * the pipeline clock and could be e.g. the NTP timestamp when the media was
 * captured.
 *
 * The reference is stored as a #GstCaps in @reference. Examples of valid
 * references would be &quot;timestamp/x-drivername-stream&quot; for timestamps that are locally
 * generated by some driver named &quot;drivername&quot; when generating the stream,
 * e.g. based on a frame counter, or &quot;timestamp/x-ntp, host=pool.ntp.org,
 * port=123&quot; for timestamps based on a specific NTP server.
 *
 * Since: 1.14
