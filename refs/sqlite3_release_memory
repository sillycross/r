** CAPI3REF: Attempt To Free Heap Memory
**
** ^The sqlite3_release_memory() interface attempts to free N bytes
** of heap memory by deallocating non-essential memory allocations
** held by the database library.   Memory used to cache database
** pages to improve performance is an example of non-essential memory.
** ^sqlite3_release_memory() returns the number of bytes actually freed,
** which might be more or less than the amount requested.
** ^The sqlite3_release_memory() routine is a no-op returning zero
** if SQLite is not compiled with [SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT].
**
** See also: [sqlite3_db_release_memory()]
