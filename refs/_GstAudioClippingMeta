 * GstAudioClippingMeta:
 * @meta: parent #GstMeta
 * @format: GstFormat of @start and @stop, GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT is samples
 * @start: Amount of audio to clip from start of buffer
 * @end: Amount of  to clip from end of buffer
 *
 * Extra buffer metadata describing how much audio has to be clipped from
 * the start or end of a buffer. This is used for compressed formats, where
 * the first frame usually has some additional samples due to encoder and
 * decoder delays, and the last frame usually has some additional samples to
 * be able to fill the complete last frame.
 *
 * This is used to ensure that decoded data in the end has the same amount of
 * samples, and multiply decoded streams can be gaplessly concatenated.
 *
 * Note: If clipping of the start is done by adjusting the segment, this meta
 * has to be dropped from buffers as otherwise clipping could happen twice.
 *
 * Since: 1.8
