frozen as the result of an event having been sent to the client (either from
the activation of a GrabKey or from a previous AllowEvents with mode
SyncKeyboard but not from a GrabKeyboard), then the keyboard grab is released
and that event is completely reprocessed, this time ignoring any passive grabs
at or above (towards the root) the grab-window of the grab just released. The
request has no effect if the keyboard is not grabbed by the client or if the
keyboard is not frozen as the result of an event. */</doc>
