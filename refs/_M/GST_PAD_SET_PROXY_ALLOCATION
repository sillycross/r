 * GST_PAD_SET_PROXY_ALLOCATION:
 * @pad: a #GstPad
 *
 * Set @pad to proxy allocation queries, which means that the default query
 * handler will forward allocation queries to the internally linked @pads
 * instead of discarding them.
 * Set this if the element always outputs data in the exact same format as it
 * receives as input. This is just for convenience to avoid implementing some
 * standard query handling code in an element.
