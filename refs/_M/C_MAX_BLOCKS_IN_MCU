 * the PostScript DCT filter can emit files with many more than 10 blocks/MCU.
 * If you happen to run across such a file, you can up D_MAX_BLOCKS_IN_MCU
 * to handle it.  We even let you do this from the jconfig.h file.  However,
 * we strongly discourage changing C_MAX_BLOCKS_IN_MCU; just because Adobe
 * sometimes emits noncompliant files doesn&apos;t mean you should too.
