 * GDK_THREADS_ENTER:
 *
 * This macro marks the beginning of a critical section in which GDK and
 * GTK+ functions can be called safely and without causing race
 * conditions.  Only one thread at a time can be in such a critial
 * section. The macro expands to a no-op if #G_THREADS_ENABLED has not
 * been defined. Typically gdk_threads_enter() should be used instead of
 * this macro.
 *
 * Deprecated:3.6: Use g_main_context_invoke(), g_idle_add() and related
 *     functions if you need to schedule GTK+ calls from other threads.
