 * gst_caps_make_writable:
 * @caps: (transfer full): a #GstCaps
 *
 * Returns a writable copy of @caps.
 *
 * If there is only one reference count on @caps, the caller must be the owner,
 * and so this function will return the caps object unchanged. If on the other
 * hand there is more than one reference on the object, a new caps object will
 * be returned. The caller&apos;s reference on @caps will be removed, and instead the
 * caller will own a reference to the returned object.
 *
 * In short, this function unrefs the caps in the argument and refs the caps
 * that it returns. Don&apos;t access the argument after calling this function. See
 * also: gst_caps_ref().
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a writable caps which may or may not be the
 *     same as @caps
