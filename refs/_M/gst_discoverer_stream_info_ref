 * GstDiscovererStreamInfo:
 *
 * Base structure for information concerning a media stream. Depending on the
 * stream type, one can find more media-specific information in
 * #GstDiscovererAudioInfo, #GstDiscovererVideoInfo, and
 * #GstDiscovererContainerInfo.
 *
 * The #GstDiscovererStreamInfo represents the topology of the stream. Siblings
 * can be iterated over with gst_discoverer_stream_info_get_next() and
 * gst_discoverer_stream_info_get_previous(). Children (sub-streams) of a
 * stream can be accessed using the #GstDiscovererContainerInfo API.
 *
 * As a simple example, if you run #GstDiscoverer on an AVI file with one audio
 * and one video stream, you will get a #GstDiscovererContainerInfo
 * corresponding to the AVI container, which in turn will have a
 * #GstDiscovererAudioInfo sub-stream and a #GstDiscovererVideoInfo sub-stream
 * for the audio and video streams respectively.
