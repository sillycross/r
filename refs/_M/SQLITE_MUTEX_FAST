** CAPI3REF: Mutex Types
**
** The [sqlite3_mutex_alloc()] interface takes a single argument
** which is one of these integer constants.
**
** The set of static mutexes may change from one SQLite release to the
** next.  Applications that override the built-in mutex logic must be
** prepared to accommodate additional static mutexes.
