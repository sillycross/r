 * GST_PLUGIN_DEFINE:
 * @major: major version number of the gstreamer-core that plugin was compiled for
 * @minor: minor version number of the gstreamer-core that plugin was compiled for
 * @name: short, but unique name of the plugin
 * @description: information about the purpose of the plugin
 * @init: function pointer to the plugin_init method with the signature of &lt;code&gt;static gboolean plugin_init (GstPlugin * plugin)&lt;/code&gt;.
 * @version: full version string (e.g. VERSION from config.h)
 * @license: under which licence the package has been released, e.g. GPL, LGPL.
 * @package: the package-name (e.g. PACKAGE_NAME from config.h)
 * @origin: a description from where the package comes from (e.g. the homepage URL)
 *
 * This macro needs to be used to define the entry point and meta data of a
 * plugin. One would use this macro to export a plugin, so that it can be used
 * by other applications.
 *
 * The macro uses a define named PACKAGE for the #GstPluginDesc,source field.
 * When using autoconf, this is usually set automatically via the AC_INIT
 * macro, and set in config.h. If you are not using autoconf, you will need to
 * define PACKAGE yourself and set it to a short mnemonic string identifying
 * your application/package, e.g. &apos;someapp&apos; or &apos;my-plugins-foo.
 *
 * If defined, the GST_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DATETIME will also be used for the
 * #GstPluginDesc,release_datetime field.
