** These no-op macros are used in front of interfaces to mark those
** interfaces as either deprecated or experimental.  New applications
** should not use deprecated interfaces - they are supported for backwards
** compatibility only.  Application writers should be aware that
** experimental interfaces are subject to change in point releases.
**
** These macros used to resolve to various kinds of compiler magic that
** would generate warning messages when they were used.  But that
** compiler magic ended up generating such a flurry of bug reports
** that we have taken it all out and gone back to using simple
** noop macros.
