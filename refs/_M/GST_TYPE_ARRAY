 * GST_TYPE_ARRAY:
 *
 * a #GValue type that represents an ordered list of #GValue values. This is
 * used to express a set of values that is meaningful only in their specific
 * combination and order of values. Each value on its own is not particularly
 * meaningful, only the ordered array in its entirety is meaningful. This is
 * used for example to express channel layouts for multichannel audio where
 * each channel needs to be mapped to a position in the room.
 *
 * Returns: the #GType of GstArrayList (which is not explicitly typed)
