 * gst_tag_list_make_writable:
 * @taglist: (transfer full): a #GstTagList
 *
 * Returns a writable copy of @taglist.
 *
 * If there is only one reference count on @taglist, the caller must be the
 * owner, and so this function will return the taglist object unchanged. If on
 * the other hand there is more than one reference on the object, a new taglist
 * object will be returned (which will be a copy of @taglist). The caller&apos;s
 * reference on @taglist will be removed, and instead the caller will own a
 * reference to the returned object.
 *
 * In short, this function unrefs the taglist in the argument and refs the
 * taglist that it returns. Don&apos;t access the argument after calling this
 * function. See also: gst_tag_list_ref().
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a writable taglist which may or may not be the
 *     same as @taglist
