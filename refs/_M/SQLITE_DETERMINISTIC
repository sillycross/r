** CAPI3REF: Function Flags
**
** These constants may be ORed together with the 
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | preferred text encoding] as the fourth argument
** to [sqlite3_create_function()], [sqlite3_create_function16()], or
** [sqlite3_create_function_v2()].
**
** &lt;dl&gt;
** [[SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
** The SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC flag means that the new function always gives
** the same output when the input parameters are the same.
** The [abs|abs() function] is deterministic, for example, but
** [randomblob|randomblob()] is not.  Functions must
** be deterministic in order to be used in certain contexts such as
** with the WHERE clause of [partial indexes] or in [generated columns].
** SQLite might also optimize deterministic functions by factoring them
** out of inner loops.
** &lt;/dd&gt;
** 
** [[SQLITE_DIRECTONLY]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_DIRECTONLY&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
** The SQLITE_DIRECTONLY flag means that the function may only be invoked
** from top-level SQL, and cannot be used in VIEWs or TRIGGERs nor in 
** schema structures such as [CHECK constraints], [DEFAULT clauses],
** [expression indexes], [partial indexes], or [generated columns].
** The SQLITE_DIRECTONLY flags is a security feature which is recommended
** for all [application-defined SQL functions], and especially for functions
** that have side-effects or that could potentially leak sensitive
** information.
** &lt;/dd&gt;
**
** [[SQLITE_INNOCUOUS]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_INNOCUOUS&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
** The SQLITE_INNOCUOUS flag means that the function is unlikely
** to cause problems even if misused.  An innocuous function should have
** no side effects and should not depend on any values other than its
** input parameters. The [abs|abs() function] is an example of an
** innocuous function.
** The [load_extension() SQL function] is not innocuous because of its
** side effects.
** &lt;p&gt; SQLITE_INNOCUOUS is similar to SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC, but is not
** exactly the same.  The [random|random() function] is an example of a
** function that is innocuous but not deterministic.
** &lt;p&gt;Some heightened security settings
** ([SQLITE_DBCONFIG_TRUSTED_SCHEMA] and [PRAGMA trusted_schema=OFF])
** disable the use of SQL functions inside views and triggers and in
** schema structures such as [CHECK constraints], [DEFAULT clauses],
** [expression indexes], [partial indexes], and [generated columns] unless
** the function is tagged with SQLITE_INNOCUOUS.  Most built-in functions
** are innocuous.  Developers are advised to avoid using the
** SQLITE_INNOCUOUS flag for application-defined functions unless the
** function has been carefully audited and found to be free of potentially
** security-adverse side-effects and information-leaks.
** &lt;/dd&gt;
**
** [[SQLITE_SUBTYPE]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_SUBTYPE&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
** The SQLITE_SUBTYPE flag indicates to SQLite that a function may call
** [sqlite3_value_subtype()] to inspect the sub-types of its arguments.
** Specifying this flag makes no difference for scalar or aggregate user
** functions. However, if it is not specified for a user-defined window
** function, then any sub-types belonging to arguments passed to the window
** function may be discarded before the window function is called (i.e.
** sqlite3_value_subtype() will always return 0).
** &lt;/dd&gt;
** &lt;/dl&gt;
