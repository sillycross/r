// - World is the supertype of all of the things.
// - Stack with a TOP payload is a direct subtype of World
// - Stack with a non-TOP payload is a direct subtype of Stack with a TOP payload.

// - Any other kind with TOP payload is the direct subtype of Heap.
// - Any other kind with non-TOP payload is the direct subtype of the same kind with a TOP payload.</doc>
