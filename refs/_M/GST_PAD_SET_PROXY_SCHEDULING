 * GST_PAD_SET_PROXY_SCHEDULING:
 * @pad: a #GstPad
 *
 * Set @pad to proxy scheduling queries, which means that the default query
 * handler will forward scheduling queries to the internally linked @pads
 * instead of discarding them. You will usually want to handle scheduling
 * queries explicitly if your element supports multiple scheduling modes.
