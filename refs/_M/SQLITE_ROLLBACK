** KEYWORDS: {conflict resolution mode}
**
** These constants are returned by [sqlite3_vtab_on_conflict()] to
** inform a [virtual table] implementation what the [ON CONFLICT] mode
** is for the SQL statement being evaluated.
**
** Note that the [SQLITE_IGNORE] constant is also used as a potential
** return value from the [sqlite3_set_authorizer()] callback and that
** [SQLITE_ABORT] is also a [result code].
