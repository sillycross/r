<doc f='include/cairo/cairo-deprecated.h' l='41'>/* Obsolete functions. These definitions exist to coerce the compiler
 * into providing a little bit of guidance with its error
 * messages. The idea is to help users port their old code without
 * having to dig through lots of documentation.
 *
 * The first set of REPLACED_BY functions is for functions whose names
 * have just been changed. So fixing these up is mechanical, (and
 * automated by means of the cairo/util/cairo-api-update script.
 *
 * The second set of DEPRECATED_BY functions is for functions where
 * the replacement is used in a different way, (ie. different
 * arguments, multiple functions instead of one, etc). Fixing these up
 * will require a bit more work on the user&apos;s part, (and hopefully we
 * can get cairo-api-update to find these and print some guiding
 * information).
