 * GST_PAD_SET_FLUSHING:
 * @pad: a #GstPad
 *
 * Set the given @pad to flushing state, which means it will not accept any
 * more events, queries or buffers, and return GST_FLOW_FLUSHING if any buffers
 * are pushed on it. This usually happens when the pad is shut down or when
 * a flushing seek happens. This is used inside GStreamer when flush start/stop
 * events pass through pads, or when an element state is changed and pads are
 * activated or deactivated.
