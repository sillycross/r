 * GST_TYPE_LIST:
 *
 * a #GValue type that represents an unordered list of #GValue values. This
 * is used for example to express a list of possible values for a field in
 * a caps structure, like a list of possible sample rates, of which only one
 * will be chosen in the end. This means that all values in the list are
 * meaningful on their own.
 *
 * Returns: the #GType of GstValueList (which is not explicitly typed)
