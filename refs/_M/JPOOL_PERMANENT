 * Allocates &quot;small&quot; objects (a few K total), &quot;large&quot; objects (tens of K),
 * and &quot;really big&quot; objects (virtual arrays with backing store if needed).
 * The memory manager does not allow individual objects to be freed; rather,
 * each created object is assigned to a pool, and whole pools can be freed
 * at once.  This is faster and more convenient than remembering exactly what
 * to free, especially where malloc()/free() are not too speedy.
 * NB: alloc routines never return NULL.  They exit to error_exit if not
 * successful.
