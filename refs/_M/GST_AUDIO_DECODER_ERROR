 * GST_AUDIO_DECODER_ERROR:
 * @el:     the base audio decoder element that generates the error
 * @weight: element defined weight of the error, added to error count
 * @domain: like CORE, LIBRARY, RESOURCE or STREAM (see #gstreamer-GstGError)
 * @code:   error code defined for that domain (see #gstreamer-GstGError)
 * @text:   the message to display (format string and args enclosed in
 *          parentheses)
 * @debug:  debugging information for the message (format string and args
 *          enclosed in parentheses)
 * @ret:    variable to receive return value
 *
 * Utility function that audio decoder elements can use in case they encountered
 * a data processing error that may be fatal for the current &quot;data unit&quot; but
 * need not prevent subsequent decoding.  Such errors are counted and if there
 * are too many, as configured in the context&apos;s max_errors, the pipeline will
 * post an error message and the application will be requested to stop further
 * media processing.  Otherwise, it is considered a &quot;glitch&quot; and only a warning
 * is logged. In either case, @ret is set to the proper value to
 * return to upstream/caller (indicating either GST_FLOW_ERROR or GST_FLOW_OK).
