 * gst_buffer_make_writable:
 * @buf: (transfer full): a #GstBuffer
 *
 * Returns a writable copy of @buf. If the source buffer is
 * already writable, this will simply return the same buffer.
 *
 * Use this function to ensure that a buffer can be safely modified before
 * making changes to it, including changing the metadata such as PTS/DTS.
 *
 * If the reference count of the source buffer @buf is exactly one, the caller
 * is the sole owner and this function will return the buffer object unchanged.
 *
 * If there is more than one reference on the object, a copy will be made using
 * gst_buffer_copy(). The passed-in @buf will be unreffed in that case, and the
 * caller will now own a reference to the new returned buffer object. Note
 * that this just copies the buffer structure itself, the underlying memory is
 * not copied if it can be shared amongst multiple buffers.
 *
 * In short, this function unrefs the buf in the argument and refs the buffer
 * that it returns. Don&apos;t access the argument after calling this function unless
 * you have an additional reference to it.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a writable buffer which may or may not be the
 *     same as @buf
