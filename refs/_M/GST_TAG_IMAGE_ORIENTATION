 * GST_TAG_IMAGE_ORIENTATION:
 *
 * Represents the &apos;Orientation&apos; tag from EXIF. Defines how the image
 * should be rotated and mirrored for display. (string)
 *
 * This tag has a predefined set of allowed values:
 *   &quot;rotate-0&quot;
 *   &quot;rotate-90&quot;
 *   &quot;rotate-180&quot;
 *   &quot;rotate-270&quot;
 *   &quot;flip-rotate-0&quot;
 *   &quot;flip-rotate-90&quot;
 *   &quot;flip-rotate-180&quot;
 *   &quot;flip-rotate-270&quot;
 *
 * The naming is adopted according to a possible transformation to perform
 * on the image to fix its orientation, obviously equivalent operations will
 * yield the same result.
 *
 * Rotations indicated by the values are in clockwise direction and
 * &apos;flip&apos; means an horizontal mirroring.
