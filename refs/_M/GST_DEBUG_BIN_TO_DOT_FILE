 * GST_DEBUG_BIN_TO_DOT_FILE:
 * @bin: the top-level pipeline that should be analyzed
 * @details: details to show in the graph, e.g. #GST_DEBUG_GRAPH_SHOW_ALL or
 *    one or more other #GstDebugGraphDetails flags.
 * @file_name: output base filename (e.g. &quot;myplayer&quot;)
 *
 * To aid debugging applications one can use this method to write out the whole
 * network of gstreamer elements that form the pipeline into an dot file.
 * This file can be processed with graphviz to get an image, like this:
 * |[
 *  dot -Tpng -oimage.png graph_lowlevel.dot
 * ]|
 * There is also a utility called xdot which allows you to view the dot file
 * directly without converting it first.
 *
 * The macro is only active if the environment variable GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR
 * is set to a basepath (e.g. /tmp), and the GStreamer debugging subsystem is
 * enabled (i.e., no use of `./configure --disable-gst-debug&apos;)
