 * G_VALUE_COLLECT:
 * @value: a #GValue return location. @value is supposed to be initialized
 *  according to the value type to be collected
 * @var_args: the va_list variable; it may be evaluated multiple times
 * @flags: flags which are passed on to the collect_value() function of
 *  the #GTypeValueTable of @value.
 * @__error: a #gchar** variable that will be modified to hold a g_new()
 *  allocated error messages if something fails
 *
 * Collects a variable argument value from a va_list. We have to
 * implement the varargs collection as a macro, because on some systems
 * va_list variables cannot be passed by reference.
 *
 * Note: If you are creating the @value argument just before calling this macro,
 * you should use the #G_VALUE_COLLECT_INIT variant and pass the unitialized
 * #GValue. That variant is faster than #G_VALUE_COLLECT.
