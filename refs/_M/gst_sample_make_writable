 * gst_sample_make_writable:
 * @sample: (transfer full): A #GstSample
 *
 * Returns a writable copy of @sample. If the source sample is
 * already writable, this will simply return the same sample.
 *
 * Use this function to ensure that a sample can be safely modified before
 * making changes to it, for example before calling gst_sample_set_buffer()
 *
 * If the reference count of the source sample @sample is exactly one, the caller
 * is the sole owner and this function will return the sample object unchanged.
 *
 * If there is more than one reference on the object, a copy will be made using
 * gst_sample_copy(). The passed-in @sample will be unreffed in that case, and the
 * caller will now own a reference to the new returned sample object.
 *
 * In short, this function unrefs the sample in the argument and refs the sample
 * that it returns. Don&apos;t access the argument after calling this function unless
 * you have an additional reference to it.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a writable sample which may or may not be the
 *     same as @sample
 *
 * Since: 1.16
