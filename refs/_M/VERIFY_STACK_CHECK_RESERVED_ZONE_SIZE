<doc f='WebKit/WTF/Headers/wtf/StackCheck.h' l='33'>// We only enable the reserved zone size check by default on ASSERT_ENABLED
// builds (which usually mean Debug builds). However, it is more valuable to
// run this test on Release builds. That said, we don&apos;t want to do pay this
// cost always because we may need to do stack checks on hot paths too.
// Note also that we&apos;re deliberately using RELEASE_ASSERTs if the verification
// is turned on. This makes it easier for us to turn this on for Release builds
// for a reserved zone size calibration test runs.</doc>
