 * Several system calls take a flag to request &quot;hugetlb&quot; huge pages.
 * Without further specification, these system calls will use the
 * system&apos;s default huge page size.  If a system supports multiple
 * huge page sizes, the desired huge page size can be specified in
 * bits [26:31] of the flag arguments.  The value in these 6 bits
 * will encode the log2 of the huge page size.
 *
 * The following definitions are associated with this huge page size
 * encoding in flag arguments.  System call specific header files
 * that use this encoding should include this file.  They can then
 * provide definitions based on these with their own specific prefix.
 * for example:
 * #define MAP_HUGE_SHIFT HUGETLB_FLAG_ENCODE_SHIFT
