 * GST_PAD_SET_PROXY_CAPS:
 * @pad: a #GstPad
 *
 * Set @pad to proxy caps, so that all caps-related events and queries are
 * proxied down- or upstream to the other side of the element automatically.
 * Set this if the element always outputs data in the exact same format as it
 * receives as input. This is just for convenience to avoid implementing some
 * standard event and query handling code in an element.
