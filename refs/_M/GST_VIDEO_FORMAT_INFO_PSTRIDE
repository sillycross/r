 * @c: the component index
 *
 * pixel stride for the given component. This is the amount of bytes to the
 * pixel immediately to the right, so basically bytes from one pixel to the
 * next. When bits &lt; 8, the stride is expressed in bits.
 *
 * Examples: for 24-bit RGB, the pixel stride would be 3 bytes, while it
 * would be 4 bytes for RGBx or ARGB, and 8 bytes for ARGB64 or AYUV64.
 * For planar formats such as I420 the pixel stride is usually 1. For
 * YUY2 it would be 2 bytes.
