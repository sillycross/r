 * Definition of macro used to set constants for size of network structures;
 * machines with preprocessors that can&apos;t handle all of the sz_ symbols
 * can define this macro to be sizeof(x) if and only if their compiler doesn&apos;t
 * pad out structures (esp. the xTextElt structure which contains only two
 * one-byte fields).  Network structures should always define sz_symbols.
 *
 * The sz_ prefix is used instead of something more descriptive so that the
 * symbols are no more than 32 characters long (which causes problems for some
 * compilers and preprocessors).
 *
 * The extra indirection is to get macro arguments to expand correctly before
 * the concatenation, rather than afterward.
