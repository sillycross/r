<doc f='WebKit/Source/ThirdParty/ANGLE/src/common/debug.h' l='302'>// Note that gSwallowStream is used instead of an arbitrary LOG() stream to avoid the creation of an
// object with a non-trivial destructor (LogMessage). On MSVC x86 (checked on 2015 Update 3), this
// causes a few additional pointless instructions to be emitted even at full optimization level,
// even though the : arm of the ternary operator is clearly never executed. Using a simpler object
// to be &amp;&apos;d with Voidify() avoids these extra instructions. Using a simpler POD object with a
// templated operator&lt;&lt; also works to avoid these instructions. However, this causes warnings on
// statically defined implementations of operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream, ...) in some .cpp files, because
// they become defined-but-unreferenced functions. A reinterpret_cast of 0 to an ostream* also is
// not suitable, because some compilers warn of undefined behavior.</doc>
