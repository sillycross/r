 * @brief check if extension is present
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param name_len The length of \a name in bytes.
 * @param name The name of the extension to query, for example &quot;RANDR&quot;. This is case
 * sensitive!
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Determines if the specified extension is present on this X11 server.
 * 
 * Every extension has a unique `major_opcode` to identify requests, the minor
 * opcodes and request formats are extension-specific. If the extension provides
 * events and errors, the `first_event` and `first_error` fields in the reply are
 * set accordingly.
 * 
 * There should rarely be a need to use this request directly, XCB provides the
 * `xcb_get_extension_data` function instead.
 *
 * This form can be used only if the request will cause
 * a reply to be generated. Any returned error will be
 * placed in the event queue.
