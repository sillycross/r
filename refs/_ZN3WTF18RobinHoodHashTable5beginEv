<doc f='WebKit/WTF/Headers/wtf/RobinHoodHashTable.h' l='135'>// When the hash table is empty, just return the same iterator for end as for begin.
    // This is more efficient because we don&apos;t have to skip all the empty and deleted
    // buckets, and iterating an empty table is a common case that&apos;s worth optimizing.</doc>
