 * @ingroup iface_wl_shell_surface
 *
 * Map the surface as a popup.
 *
 * A popup surface is a transient surface with an added pointer
 * grab.
 *
 * An existing implicit grab will be changed to owner-events mode,
 * and the popup grab will continue after the implicit grab ends
 * (i.e. releasing the mouse button does not cause the popup to
 * be unmapped).
 *
 * The popup grab continues until the window is destroyed or a
 * mouse button is pressed in any other client&apos;s window. A click
 * in any of the client&apos;s surfaces is reported as normal, however,
 * clicks in other clients&apos; surfaces will be discarded and trigger
 * the callback.
 *
 * The x and y arguments specify the location of the upper left
 * corner of the surface relative to the upper left corner of the
 * parent surface, in surface-local coordinates.
