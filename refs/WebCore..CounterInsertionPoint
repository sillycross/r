<doc f='WebKit/Source/WebCore/rendering/RenderCounter.cpp' l='196'>// - Finds the insertion point for the counter described by counterOwner, isReset and 
// identifier in the CounterNode tree for identifier and sets parent and
// previousSibling accordingly.
// - The function returns true if the counter whose insertion point is searched is NOT
// the root of the tree.
// - The root of the tree is a counter reference that is not in the scope of any other
// counter with the same identifier.
// - All the counter references with the same identifier as this one that are in
// children or subsequent siblings of the renderer that owns the root of the tree
// form the rest of of the nodes of the tree.
// - The root of the tree is always a reset type reference.
// - A subtree rooted at any reset node in the tree is equivalent to all counter 
// references that are in the scope of the counter or nested counter defined by that
// reset node.
// - Non-reset CounterNodes cannot have descendants.</doc>
