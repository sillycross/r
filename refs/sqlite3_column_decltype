** CAPI3REF: Declared Datatype Of A Query Result
** METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
**
** ^(The first parameter is a [prepared statement].
** If this statement is a [SELECT] statement and the Nth column of the
** returned result set of that [SELECT] is a table column (not an
** expression or subquery) then the declared type of the table
** column is returned.)^  ^If the Nth column of the result set is an
** expression or subquery, then a NULL pointer is returned.
** ^The returned string is always UTF-8 encoded.
**
** ^(For example, given the database schema:
**
** CREATE TABLE t1(c1 VARIANT);
**
** and the following statement to be compiled:
**
** SELECT c1 + 1, c1 FROM t1;
**
** this routine would return the string &quot;VARIANT&quot; for the second result
** column (i==1), and a NULL pointer for the first result column (i==0).)^
**
** ^SQLite uses dynamic run-time typing.  ^So just because a column
** is declared to contain a particular type does not mean that the
** data stored in that column is of the declared type.  SQLite is
** strongly typed, but the typing is dynamic not static.  ^Type
** is associated with individual values, not with the containers
** used to hold those values.
