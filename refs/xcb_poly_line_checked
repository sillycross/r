 * @brief draw lines

 * @param c The connection
 * @param coordinate_mode A bitmask of #xcb_coord_mode_t values.
 * @param coordinate_mode \n
 * @param drawable The drawable to draw the line(s) on.
 * @param gc The graphics context to use.
 * @param points_len The number of `xcb_point_t` structures in \a points.
 * @param points An array of points.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Draws \a points_len-1 lines between each pair of points (point[i], point[i+1])
 * in the \a points array. The lines are drawn in the order listed in the array.
 * They join correctly at all intermediate points, and if the first and last
 * points coincide, the first and last lines also join correctly. For any given
 * line, a pixel is not drawn more than once. If thin (zero line-width) lines
 * intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times. If wide lines
 * intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn only once, as though the entire
 * request were a single, filled shape.
 *
 * This form can be used only if the request will not cause
 * a reply to be generated. Any returned error will be
 * saved for handling by xcb_request_check().
