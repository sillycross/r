 * gst_query_replace:
 * @old_query: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a pointer to a
 *     #GstQuery to be replaced.
 * @new_query: (allow-none) (transfer none): pointer to a #GstQuery that will
 *     replace the query pointed to by @old_query.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstQuery to point to a different #GstQuery. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread safety
 * in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately (the old
 * query is unreffed, the new one is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_query or the #GstQuery pointed to by @old_query may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_query was different from @old_query
