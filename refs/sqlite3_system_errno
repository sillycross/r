** CAPI3REF: Low-level system error code
**
** ^Attempt to return the underlying operating system error code or error
** number that caused the most recent I/O error or failure to open a file.
** The return value is OS-dependent.  For example, on unix systems, after
** [sqlite3_open_v2()] returns [SQLITE_CANTOPEN], this interface could be
** called to get back the underlying &quot;errno&quot; that caused the problem, such
** as ENOSPC, EAUTH, EISDIR, and so forth.
