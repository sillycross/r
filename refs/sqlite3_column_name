** CAPI3REF: Column Names In A Result Set
** METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
**
** ^These routines return the name assigned to a particular column
** in the result set of a [SELECT] statement.  ^The sqlite3_column_name()
** interface returns a pointer to a zero-terminated UTF-8 string
** and sqlite3_column_name16() returns a pointer to a zero-terminated
** UTF-16 string.  ^The first parameter is the [prepared statement]
** that implements the [SELECT] statement. ^The second parameter is the
** column number.  ^The leftmost column is number 0.
**
** ^The returned string pointer is valid until either the [prepared statement]
** is destroyed by [sqlite3_finalize()] or until the statement is automatically
** reprepared by the first call to [sqlite3_step()] for a particular run
** or until the next call to
** sqlite3_column_name() or sqlite3_column_name16() on the same column.
**
** ^If sqlite3_malloc() fails during the processing of either routine
** (for example during a conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16) then a
** NULL pointer is returned.
**
** ^The name of a result column is the value of the &quot;AS&quot; clause for
** that column, if there is an AS clause.  If there is no AS clause
** then the name of the column is unspecified and may change from
** one release of SQLite to the next.
