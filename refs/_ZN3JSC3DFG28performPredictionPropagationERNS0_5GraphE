// that node is either a heap load, a call, a GetLocal for an argument, or an
// arithmetic op that had definitely taken slow path. Most nodes (even most
// arithmetic nodes) do not qualify for any of these categories. But after running
// this phase, we&apos;ll have full information for the expected type of each node.</doc>
