** CAPI3REF:  Translate filenames
**
** These routines are available to [VFS|custom VFS implementations] for
** translating filenames between the main database file, the journal file,
** and the WAL file.
**
** If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
** passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, then sqlite3_filename_database(F)
** returns the name of the corresponding database file.
**
** If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
** passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, or if F is a database filename
** obtained from [sqlite3_db_filename()], then sqlite3_filename_journal(F)
** returns the name of the corresponding rollback journal file.
**
** If F is the name of an sqlite database file, journal file, or WAL file
** that was passed by the SQLite core into the VFS, or if F is a database
** filename obtained from [sqlite3_db_filename()], then
** sqlite3_filename_wal(F) returns the name of the corresponding
** WAL file.
**
** In all of the above, if F is not the name of a database, journal or WAL
** filename passed into the VFS from the SQLite core and F is not the
** return value from [sqlite3_db_filename()], then the result is
** undefined and is likely a memory access violation.
