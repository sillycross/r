 * @brief Prefetch the maximum request length without blocking.
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 *
 * Without blocking, does as much work as possible toward computing
 * the maximum request length accepted by the X server.
 *
 * Invoking this function may cause a call to xcb_big_requests_enable,
 * but will not block waiting for the reply.
 * xcb_get_maximum_request_length will return the prefetched data
 * after possibly blocking while the reply is retrieved.
 *
 * Note that in order for this function to be fully non-blocking, the
 * application must previously have called
 * xcb_prefetch_extension_data(c, &amp;xcb_big_requests_id) and the reply
 * must have already arrived.
