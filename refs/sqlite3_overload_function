** CAPI3REF: Overload A Function For A Virtual Table
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^(Virtual tables can provide alternative implementations of functions
** using the [xFindFunction] method of the [virtual table module].  
** But global versions of those functions
** must exist in order to be overloaded.)^
**
** ^(This API makes sure a global version of a function with a particular
** name and number of parameters exists.  If no such function exists
** before this API is called, a new function is created.)^  ^The implementation
** of the new function always causes an exception to be thrown.  So
** the new function is not good for anything by itself.  Its only
** purpose is to be a placeholder function that can be overloaded
** by a [virtual table].
