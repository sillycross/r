obscured regions when the window is mapped would be beneficial. A backing-store
of `Always` advises the server that maintaining contents even when the window
is unmapped would be beneficial. In this case, the server may generate an
exposure event when the window is created. A value of `NotUseful` advises the
server that maintaining contents is unnecessary, although a server may still
choose to maintain contents while the window is mapped. Note that if the server
maintains contents, then the server should maintain complete contents not just
the region within the parent boundaries, even if the window is larger than its
parent. While the server maintains contents, exposure events will not normally
be generated, but the server may stop maintaining contents at any time. */</doc>
