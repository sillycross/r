 * @ingroup iface_wl_data_offer
 *
 * To transfer the offered data, the client issues this request
 * and indicates the mime type it wants to receive.  The transfer
 * happens through the passed file descriptor (typically created
 * with the pipe system call).  The source client writes the data
 * in the mime type representation requested and then closes the
 * file descriptor.
 *
 * The receiving client reads from the read end of the pipe until
 * EOF and then closes its end, at which point the transfer is
 * complete.
 *
 * This request may happen multiple times for different mime types,
 * both before and after wl_data_device.drop. Drag-and-drop destination
 * clients may preemptively fetch data or examine it more closely to
 * determine acceptance.
