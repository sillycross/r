 * GdkKeymapKey:
 * @keycode: the hardware keycode. This is an identifying number for a
 *   physical key.
 * @group: indicates movement in a horizontal direction. Usually groups are used
 *   for two different languages. In group 0, a key might have two English
 *   characters, and in group 1 it might have two Hebrew characters. The Hebrew
 *   characters will be printed on the key next to the English characters.
 * @level: indicates which symbol on the key will be used, in a vertical direction.
 *   So on a standard US keyboard, the key with the number “1” on it also has the
 *   exclamation point (&quot;!&quot;) character on it. The level indicates whether to use
 *   the “1” or the “!” symbol. The letter keys are considered to have a lowercase
 *   letter at level 0, and an uppercase letter at level 1, though only the
 *   uppercase letter is printed.
 *
 * A #GdkKeymapKey is a hardware key that can be mapped to a keyval.
