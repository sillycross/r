 * GstBuffer:
 * @mini_object: the parent structure
 * @pool: pointer to the pool owner of the buffer
 * @pts: presentation timestamp of the buffer, can be #GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when the
 *     pts is not known or relevant. The pts contains the timestamp when the
 *     media should be presented to the user.
 * @dts: decoding timestamp of the buffer, can be #GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when the
 *     dts is not known or relevant. The dts contains the timestamp when the
 *     media should be processed.
 * @duration: duration in time of the buffer data, can be #GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE
 *     when the duration is not known or relevant.
 * @offset: a media specific offset for the buffer data.
 *     For video frames, this is the frame number of this buffer.
 *     For audio samples, this is the offset of the first sample in this buffer.
 *     For file data or compressed data this is the byte offset of the first
 *       byte in this buffer.
 * @offset_end: the last offset contained in this buffer. It has the same
 *     format as @offset.
 *
 * The structure of a #GstBuffer. Use the associated macros to access the public
 * variables.
