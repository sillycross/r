Miter               The outer edges of the two lines extend to meet at an angle. However, if the
                    angle is less than 11 degrees, a Bevel join-style is used instead.
Round               The result is a circular arc with a diameter equal to the line-width, centered
                    on the joinpoint.
Bevel               The result is Butt endpoint styles, and then the triangular notch is filled. */</doc>
