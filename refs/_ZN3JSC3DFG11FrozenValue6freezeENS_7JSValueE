<doc f='WebKit/Source/JavaScriptCore/dfg/DFGFrozenValue.h' l='107'>// This is a utility method for DFG::Graph::freeze(). You should almost always call
    // Graph::freeze() directly. Calling this instead of Graph::freeze() can result in
    // the same constant being viewed as having different structures during the course
    // of compilation, which can sometimes cause bad things to happen. For example, we
    // may observe that one version of the constant has an unwatchable structure but
    // then a later version may start to have a watchable structure due to a transition.
    // The point of freezing is to ensure that we generally only see one version of
    // constants, but that requires freezing through the Graph.</doc>
