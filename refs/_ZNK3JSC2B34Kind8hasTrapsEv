    // trap as part of some check it performs, and that we mean to make this observable. This
    // currently only applies to memory accesses (loads and stores). You don&apos;t get to find out where
    // in the Procedure the trap happened. If you try to work it out using Origin, you&apos;ll have a bad
    // time because the instruction selector is too sloppy with Origin().
