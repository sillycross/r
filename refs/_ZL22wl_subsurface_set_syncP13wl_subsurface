 * @ingroup iface_wl_subsurface
 *
 * Change the commit behaviour of the sub-surface to synchronized
 * mode, also described as the parent dependent mode.
 *
 * In synchronized mode, wl_surface.commit on a sub-surface will
 * accumulate the committed state in a cache, but the state will
 * not be applied and hence will not change the compositor output.
 * The cached state is applied to the sub-surface immediately after
 * the parent surface&apos;s state is applied. This ensures atomic
 * updates of the parent and all its synchronized sub-surfaces.
 * Applying the cached state will invalidate the cache, so further
 * parent surface commits do not (re-)apply old state.
 *
 * See wl_subsurface for the recursive effect of this mode.
