 * @brief Sets input focus
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param revert_to A bitmask of #xcb_input_focus_t values.
 * @param revert_to Specifies what happens when the \a focus window becomes unviewable (if \a focus
 * is neither `XCB_NONE` nor `XCB_POINTER_ROOT`).
 * @param focus The window to focus. All keyboard events will be reported to this window. The
 * window must be viewable (TODO), or a `xcb_match_error_t` occurs (TODO).
 * \n
 * If \a focus is `XCB_NONE` (TODO), all keyboard events are
 * discarded until a new focus window is set.
 * \n
 * If \a focus is `XCB_POINTER_ROOT` (TODO), focus is on the root window of the
 * screen on which the pointer is on currently.
 * @param time Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_CURRENT_TIME` will be replaced with the current server
 * time.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Changes the input focus and the last-focus-change time. If the specified \a time
 * is earlier than the current last-focus-change time, the request is ignored (to
 * avoid race conditions when running X over the network).
 * 
 * A FocusIn and FocusOut event is generated when focus is changed.
 *
 * This form can be used only if the request will not cause
 * a reply to be generated. Any returned error will be
 * saved for handling by xcb_request_check().
