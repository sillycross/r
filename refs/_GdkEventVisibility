 * GdkEventVisibility:
 * @type: the type of the event (%GDK_VISIBILITY_NOTIFY).
 * @window: the window which received the event.
 * @send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.
 * @state: the new visibility state (%GDK_VISIBILITY_FULLY_OBSCURED,
 *   %GDK_VISIBILITY_PARTIAL or %GDK_VISIBILITY_UNOBSCURED).
 *
 * Generated when the window visibility status has changed.
 *
 * Deprecated: 3.12: Modern composited windowing systems with pervasive
 *     transparency make it impossible to track the visibility of a window
 *     reliably, so this event can not be guaranteed to provide useful
 *     information.
