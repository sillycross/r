 * gst_query_take:
 * @old_query: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a
 *     pointer to a #GstQuery to be stolen.
 * @new_query: (allow-none) (transfer full): pointer to a #GstQuery that will
 *     replace the query pointed to by @old_query.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstQuery to point to a different #GstQuery. This
 * function is similar to gst_query_replace() except that it takes ownership of
 * @new_query.
 *
 * Either @new_query or the #GstQuery pointed to by @old_query may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_query was different from @old_query
 *
 * Since: 1.16
