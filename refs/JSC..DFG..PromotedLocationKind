<doc f='WebKit/Source/JavaScriptCore/dfg/DFGPromotedHeapLocation.h' l='39'>// Promoted locations are like heap locations but are meant to be more precise. A heap location is
// applicable to CSE scenarios, where it makes sense to speak of a location very abstractly. A
// promoted heap location is for cases where we speak of a specific object and the compiler knows
// this object&apos;s identity - for example, the object allocation has been eliminated and we turned the
// fields into local variables. Because these two cases have subtly different needs, we use subtly
// different structures. One of the really significant differences is that promoted locations can be
// spoken of using either a descriptor which does not refer to any Node*&apos;s or with a heap location,
// which is a descriptor with a Node* base.</doc>
