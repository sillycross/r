 * This function is the primary interface to the &quot;extension cache&quot;,
 * which caches reply information from QueryExtension
 * requests. Invoking this function may cause a call to
 * xcb_query_extension to retrieve extension information from the
 * server, and may block until extension data is received from the
 * server.
 *
 * The result must not be freed. This storage is managed by the cache
 * itself.
