** CAPI3REF: Serialize a database
**
** The sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F) interface returns a pointer to memory
** that is a serialization of the S database on [database connection] D.
** If P is not a NULL pointer, then the size of the database in bytes
** is written into *P.
**
** For an ordinary on-disk database file, the serialization is just a
** copy of the disk file.  For an in-memory database or a &quot;TEMP&quot; database,
** the serialization is the same sequence of bytes which would be written
** to disk if that database where backed up to disk.
**
** The usual case is that sqlite3_serialize() copies the serialization of
** the database into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc64()] and returns
** a pointer to that memory.  The caller is responsible for freeing the
** returned value to avoid a memory leak.  However, if the F argument
** contains the SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit, then no memory allocations
** are made, and the sqlite3_serialize() function will return a pointer
** to the contiguous memory representation of the database that SQLite
** is currently using for that database, or NULL if the no such contiguous
** memory representation of the database exists.  A contiguous memory
** representation of the database will usually only exist if there has
** been a prior call to [sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,...)] with the same
** values of D and S.
** The size of the database is written into *P even if the 
** SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit is set but no contiguous copy
** of the database exists.
**
** A call to sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F) might return NULL even if the
** SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit is omitted from argument F if a memory
** allocation error occurs.
**
** This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE] option.
