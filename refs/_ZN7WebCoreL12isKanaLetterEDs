<doc f='WebKit/Source/WebCore/editing/TextIterator.cpp' l='1672'>// ICU&apos;s search ignores the distinction between small kana letters and ones
// that are not small, and also characters that differ only in the voicing
// marks when considering only primary collation strength differences.
// This is not helpful for end users, since these differences make words
// distinct, so for our purposes we need these to be considered.
// The Unicode folks do not think the collation algorithm should be
// changed. To work around this, we would like to tailor the ICU searcher,
// but we can&apos;t get that to work yet. So instead, we check for cases where
// these differences occur, and skip those matches.

// We refer to the above technique as the &quot;kana workaround&quot;. The next few
// functions are helper functinos for the kana workaround.</doc>
