 * gst_caps_take:
 * @old_caps: (inout) (transfer full): pointer to a pointer to a #GstCaps to be
 *     replaced.
 * @new_caps: (transfer full) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstCaps that will
 *     replace the caps pointed to by @old_caps.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstCaps to point to a different #GstCaps. This
 * function is similar to gst_caps_replace() except that it takes ownership
 * of @new_caps.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_caps was different from @old_caps
