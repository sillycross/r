      * When turned on, this attribute makes
      * substrings of digits sort according to their numeric values.
      *
      * This is a way to get &apos;100&apos; to sort AFTER &apos;2&apos;. Note that the longest
      * digit substring that can be treated as a single unit is
      * 254 digits (not counting leading zeros). If a digit substring is
      * longer than that, the digits beyond the limit will be treated as a
      * separate digit substring.
      *
      * A &quot;digit&quot; in this sense is a code point with General_Category=Nd,
      * which does not include circled numbers, roman numerals, etc.
      * Only a contiguous digit substring is considered, that is,
      * non-negative integers without separators.
      * There is no support for plus/minus signs, decimals, exponents, etc.
