 * @brief Return the error for a request, or NULL if none can ever arrive.
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 * @param cookie The request cookie.
 * @return The error for the request, or NULL if none can ever arrive.
 *
 * The xcb_void_cookie_t cookie supplied to this function must have resulted
 * from a call to xcb_[request_name]_checked().  This function will block
 * until one of two conditions happens.  If an error is received, it will be
 * returned.  If a reply to a subsequent request has already arrived, no error
 * can arrive for this request, so this function will return NULL.
 *
 * Note that this function will perform a sync if needed to ensure that the
 * sequence number will advance beyond that provided in cookie; this is a
 * convenience to avoid races in determining whether the sync is needed.
