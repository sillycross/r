 * @brief Returns the next event without reading from the connection.
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 * @return The next already queued event from the server.
 *
 * This is a version of xcb_poll_for_event that only examines the
 * event queue for new events. The function doesn&apos;t try to read new
 * events from the connection if no queued events are found.
 *
 * This function is useful for callers that know in advance that all
 * interesting events have already been read from the connection. For
 * example, callers might use xcb_wait_for_reply and be interested
 * only of events that preceded a specific reply.
