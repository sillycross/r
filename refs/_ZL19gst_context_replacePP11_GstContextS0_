 * gst_context_replace:
 * @old_context: (inout) (transfer full): pointer to a pointer to a #GstContext
 *     to be replaced.
 * @new_context: (allow-none) (transfer none): pointer to a #GstContext that will
 *     replace the context pointed to by @old_context.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstContext to point to a different #GstContext. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread safety
 * in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately (the old
 * context is unreffed, the new one is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_context or the #GstContext pointed to by @old_context may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_context was different from @old_context
