<doc f='WebKit/Source/JavaScriptCore/bytecode/PropertyCondition.h' l='238'>// Two conditions are compatible if they are identical or if they speak of different uids. If
    // false is returned, you have to decide how to resolve the conflict - for example if there is
    // a Presence and an Equivalence then in some cases you&apos;ll want the more general of the two
    // while in other cases you&apos;ll want the more specific of the two. This will also return false
    // for contradictions, like Presence and Absence on the same uid. By convention, invalid
    // conditions aren&apos;t compatible with anything.</doc>
