 * GdkEventGrabBroken:
 * @type: the type of the event (%GDK_GRAB_BROKEN)
 * @window: the window which received the event, i.e. the window
 *   that previously owned the grab
 * @send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.
 * @keyboard: %TRUE if a keyboard grab was broken, %FALSE if a pointer
 *   grab was broken
 * @implicit: %TRUE if the broken grab was implicit
 * @grab_window: If this event is caused by another grab in the same
 *   application, @grab_window contains the new grab window. Otherwise
 *   @grab_window is %NULL.
 *
 * Generated when a pointer or keyboard grab is broken. On X11, this happens
 * when the grab window becomes unviewable (i.e. it or one of its ancestors
 * is unmapped), or if the same application grabs the pointer or keyboard
 * again. Note that implicit grabs (which are initiated by button presses)
 * can also cause #GdkEventGrabBroken events.
 *
 * Since: 2.8
