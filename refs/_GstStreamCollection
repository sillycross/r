 * GstStreamCollection:
 *
 * A collection of #GstStream that are available.
 *
 * A #GstStreamCollection will be provided by elements that can make those
 * streams available. Applications can use the collection to show the user
 * what streams are available by using %gst_stream_collection_get_stream()
 *
 * Once posted, a #GstStreamCollection is immutable. Updates are made by sending
 * a new #GstStreamCollection message, which may or may not share some of
 * the #GstStream objects from the collection it replaces. The receiver can check
 * the sender of a stream collection message to know which collection is
 * obsoleted.
 *
 * Several elements in a pipeline can provide #GstStreamCollection.
 *
 * Applications can activate streams from a collection by using the
 * #GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS event on a pipeline, bin or element.
 *
 * Since: 1.10
