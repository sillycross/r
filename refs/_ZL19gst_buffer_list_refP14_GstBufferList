 * gst_buffer_list_ref:
 * @list: a #GstBufferList
 *
 * Increases the refcount of the given buffer list by one.
 *
 * Note that the refcount affects the writability of @list and its data, see
 * gst_buffer_list_make_writable(). It is important to note that keeping
 * additional references to GstBufferList instances can potentially increase
 * the number of memcpy operations in a pipeline.

 * Returns: (transfer full): @list
