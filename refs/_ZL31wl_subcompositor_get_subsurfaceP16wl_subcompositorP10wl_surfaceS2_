 * @ingroup iface_wl_subcompositor
 *
 * Create a sub-surface interface for the given surface, and
 * associate it with the given parent surface. This turns a
 * plain wl_surface into a sub-surface.
 *
 * The to-be sub-surface must not already have another role, and it
 * must not have an existing wl_subsurface object. Otherwise a protocol
 * error is raised.
 *
 * Adding sub-surfaces to a parent is a double-buffered operation on the
 * parent (see wl_surface.commit). The effect of adding a sub-surface
 * becomes visible on the next time the state of the parent surface is
 * applied.
 *
 * This request modifies the behaviour of wl_surface.commit request on
 * the sub-surface, see the documentation on wl_subsurface interface.
