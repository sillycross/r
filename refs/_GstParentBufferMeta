 * GstParentBufferMeta:
 * @parent: the parent #GstMeta structure
 * @buffer: the #GstBuffer on which a reference is being held.
 *
 * The #GstParentBufferMeta is a #GstMeta which can be attached to a #GstBuffer
 * to hold a reference to another buffer that is only released when the child
 * #GstBuffer is released.
 *
 * Typically, #GstParentBufferMeta is used when the child buffer is directly
 * using the #GstMemory of the parent buffer, and wants to prevent the parent
 * buffer from being returned to a buffer pool until the #GstMemory is available
 * for re-use.
 *
 * Since: 1.6
