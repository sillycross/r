 * gst_buffer_list_replace:
 * @old_list: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a pointer to a
 *     #GstBufferList to be replaced.
 * @new_list: (transfer none) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstBufferList that
 *     will replace the buffer list pointed to by @old_list.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstBufferList to point to a different
 * #GstBufferList. The modification is done atomically (so this is useful for
 * ensuring thread safety in some cases), and the reference counts are updated
 * appropriately (the old buffer list is unreffed, the new is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_list or the #GstBufferList pointed to by @old_list may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_list was different from @old_list
 *
 * Since: 1.16
