NotLast    The result is equivalent to Butt, except that for a line-width of zero the final
           endpoint is not drawn.
Butt       The result is square at the endpoint (perpendicular to the slope of the line)
           with no projection beyond.
Round      The result is a circular arc with its diameter equal to the line-width, centered
           on the endpoint; it is equivalent to Butt for line-width zero.
Projecting The result is square at the end, but the path continues beyond the endpoint for
           a distance equal to half the line-width; it is equivalent to Butt for line-width
           zero. */</doc>
