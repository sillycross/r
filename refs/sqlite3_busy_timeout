** CAPI3REF: Set A Busy Timeout
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^This routine sets a [sqlite3_busy_handler | busy handler] that sleeps
** for a specified amount of time when a table is locked.  ^The handler
** will sleep multiple times until at least &quot;ms&quot; milliseconds of sleeping
** have accumulated.  ^After at least &quot;ms&quot; milliseconds of sleeping,
** the handler returns 0 which causes [sqlite3_step()] to return
** [SQLITE_BUSY].
**
** ^Calling this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero
** turns off all busy handlers.
**
** ^(There can only be a single busy handler for a particular
** [database connection] at any given moment.  If another busy handler
** was defined  (using [sqlite3_busy_handler()]) prior to calling
** this routine, that other busy handler is cleared.)^
**
