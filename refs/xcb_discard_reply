 * @brief Discards the reply for a request.
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 * @param sequence The request sequence number from a cookie.
 *
 * Discards the reply for a request. Additionally, any error generated
 * by the request is also discarded (unless it was an _unchecked request
 * and the error has already arrived).
 *
 * This function will not block even if the reply is not yet available.
 *
 * Note that the sequence really does have to come from an xcb cookie;
 * this function is not designed to operate on socket-handoff replies.
