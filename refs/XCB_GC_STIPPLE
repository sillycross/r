<doc f='include/xcb/xproto.h' l='3095'>/**&lt; The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensional plane with the tile/stipple replicated in all
dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in a graphics operation,
the upper-left corner of some instance of the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within the drawable
specified by the tile/stipple origin. The tile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative to the
origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a graphics request.
The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as the gcontext (or a Match error results).
The stipple pixmap must have depth one and must have the same root as the gcontext (or a
Match error results). For fill-style Stippled (but not fill-style
OpaqueStippled), the stipple pattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an
additional clip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask.
Any size pixmap can be used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes may be faster to use than
others. */</doc>
