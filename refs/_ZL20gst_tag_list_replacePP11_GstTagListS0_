 * gst_tag_list_replace:
 * @old_taglist: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a pointer to a
 *     #GstTagList to be replaced.
 * @new_taglist: (transfer none) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstTagList that
 *     will replace the tag list pointed to by @old_taglist.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstTagList to point to a different #GstTagList. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread
 * safety in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately
 * (the old tag list is unreffed, the new is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_taglist or the #GstTagList pointed to by @old_taglist may be
 * %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_taglist was different from @old_taglist
 *
 * Since: 1.16
