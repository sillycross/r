 * gst_tag_list_take:
 * @old_taglist: (inout) (transfer full): pointer to a pointer to a #GstTagList
 *     to be replaced.
 * @new_taglist: (transfer full) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstTagList that
 *     will replace the taglist pointed to by @old_taglist.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstTagList to point to a different #GstTagList.
 * This function is similar to gst_tag_list_replace() except that it takes
 * ownership of @new_taglist.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_taglist was different from @old_taglist
 *
 * Since: 1.16
