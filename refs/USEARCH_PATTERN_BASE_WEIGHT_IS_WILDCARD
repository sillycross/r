     * Value for USEARCH_ELEMENT_COMPARISON;
     * collation element comparison is modified to effectively provide
     * behavior between the specified strength and strength - 1. Collation
     * elements in the pattern that have the base weight for the specified
     * strength are treated as &quot;wildcards&quot; that match an element with any
     * other weight at that collation level in the searched text. For
     * example, with a secondary-strength English collator, a plain &apos;e&apos; in
     * the pattern will match a plain e or an e with any diacritic in the
     * searched text, but an e with diacritic in the pattern will only
     * match an e with the same diacritic in the searched text.
