** CAPI3REF: Pseudo-Random Number Generator
**
** SQLite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to
** select random [ROWID | ROWIDs] when inserting new records into a table that
** already uses the largest possible [ROWID].  The PRNG is also used for
** the built-in random() and randomblob() SQL functions.  This interface allows
** applications to access the same PRNG for other purposes.
**
** ^A call to this routine stores N bytes of randomness into buffer P.
** ^The P parameter can be a NULL pointer.
**
** ^If this routine has not been previously called or if the previous
** call had N less than one or a NULL pointer for P, then the PRNG is
** seeded using randomness obtained from the xRandomness method of
** the default [sqlite3_vfs] object.
** ^If the previous call to this routine had an N of 1 or more and a
** non-NULL P then the pseudo-randomness is generated
** internally and without recourse to the [sqlite3_vfs] xRandomness
** method.
