<doc f='WebKit/Source/JavaScriptCore/dfg/DFGCSEPhase.cpp' l='345'>// This permits SmallMaps to be used for blocks that have up to 100 nodes. In practice,
        // fewer than half of the nodes in a block have pure defs, and even fewer have impure defs.
        // Thus, a capacity limit of 100 probably means that somewhere around ~40 things may end up
        // in one of these &quot;small&quot; list-based maps. That number still seems largeish, except that
        // the overhead of HashMaps can be quite high currently: clearing them, or even removing
        // enough things from them, deletes (or resizes) their backing store eagerly. Hence
        // HashMaps induce a lot of malloc traffic.</doc>
