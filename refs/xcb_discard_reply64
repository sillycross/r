 * @brief Discards the reply for a request, given by a 64bit sequence number
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 * @param sequence 64-bit sequence number as returned by xcb_send_request64().
 *
 * Discards the reply for a request. Additionally, any error generated
 * by the request is also discarded (unless it was an _unchecked request
 * and the error has already arrived).
 *
 * This function will not block even if the reply is not yet available.
 *
 * Note that the sequence really does have to come from xcb_send_request64();
 * the cookie sequence number is defined as &quot;unsigned&quot; int and therefore
 * not 64-bit on all platforms.
 * This function is not designed to operate on socket-handoff replies.
 *
 * Unlike its xcb_discard_reply() counterpart, the given sequence number is not
 * automatically &quot;widened&quot; to 64-bit.
