<doc f='include/xcb/xproto.h' l='3132'>/**&lt; For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows are additionally
clipped by all viewable InputOutput children. For IncludeInferiors, neither
source nor destination window is
clipped by inferiors. This will result in including subwindow contents in the source and drawing
through subwindow boundaries of the destination. The use of IncludeInferiors with a source or
destination window of one depth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is not illegal, but the
semantics is undefined by the core protocol. */</doc>
