 * @ingroup iface_wl_data_source
 *
 * Sets the actions that the source side client supports for this
 * operation. This request may trigger wl_data_source.action and
 * wl_data_offer.action events if the compositor needs to change the
 * selected action.
 *
 * The dnd_actions argument must contain only values expressed in the
 * wl_data_device_manager.dnd_actions enum, otherwise it will result
 * in a protocol error.
 *
 * This request must be made once only, and can only be made on sources
 * used in drag-and-drop, so it must be performed before
 * wl_data_device.start_drag. Attempting to use the source other than
 * for drag-and-drop will raise a protocol error.
