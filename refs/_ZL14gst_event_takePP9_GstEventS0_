 * gst_event_take:
 * @old_event: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a
 *     pointer to a #GstEvent to be stolen.
 * @new_event: (allow-none) (transfer full): pointer to a #GstEvent that will
 *     replace the event pointed to by @old_event.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstEvent to point to a different #GstEvent. This
 * function is similar to gst_event_replace() except that it takes ownership of
 * @new_event.
 *
 * Either @new_event or the #GstEvent pointed to by @old_event may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_event was different from @old_event
