 * size BUFLEN.  This function is, in contrast to gpg_strerror,
 * thread-safe if a thread-safe strerror_r() function is provided by
 * the system.  If the function succeeds, 0 is returned and BUF
 * contains the string describing the error.  If the buffer was not
 * large enough, ERANGE is returned and BUF contains as much of the
