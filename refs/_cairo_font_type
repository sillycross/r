 * cairo_font_type_t:
 * @CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_TOY: The font was created using cairo&apos;s toy font api (Since: 1.2)
 * @CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_FT: The font is of type FreeType (Since: 1.2)
 * @CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_WIN32: The font is of type Win32 (Since: 1.2)
 * @CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_QUARTZ: The font is of type Quartz (Since: 1.6, in 1.2 and
 * 1.4 it was named CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_ATSUI)
 * @CAIRO_FONT_TYPE_USER: The font was create using cairo&apos;s user font api (Since: 1.8)
 *
 * #cairo_font_type_t is used to describe the type of a given font
 * face or scaled font. The font types are also known as &quot;font
 * backends&quot; within cairo.
 *
 * The type of a font face is determined by the function used to
 * create it, which will generally be of the form
 * &lt;function&gt;cairo_&lt;emphasis&gt;type&lt;/emphasis&gt;_font_face_create(&lt;!-- --&gt;)&lt;/function&gt;.
 * The font face type can be queried with cairo_font_face_get_type()
 *
 * The various #cairo_font_face_t functions can be used with a font face
 * of any type.
 *
 * The type of a scaled font is determined by the type of the font
 * face passed to cairo_scaled_font_create(). The scaled font type can
 * be queried with cairo_scaled_font_get_type()
 *
 * The various #cairo_scaled_font_t functions can be used with scaled
 * fonts of any type, but some font backends also provide
 * type-specific functions that must only be called with a scaled font
 * of the appropriate type. These functions have names that begin with
 * &lt;function&gt;cairo_&lt;emphasis&gt;type&lt;/emphasis&gt;_scaled_font(&lt;!-- --&gt;)&lt;/function&gt;
 * such as cairo_ft_scaled_font_lock_face().
 *
 * The behavior of calling a type-specific function with a scaled font
 * of the wrong type is undefined.
 *
 * New entries may be added in future versions.
 *
 * Since: 1.2
