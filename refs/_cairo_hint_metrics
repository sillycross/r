 * @CAIRO_HINT_METRICS_ON: Hint font metrics, since 1.0
 *
 * Specifies whether to hint font metrics; hinting font metrics
 * means quantizing them so that they are integer values in
 * device space. Doing this improves the consistency of
 * letter and line spacing, however it also means that text
 * will be laid out differently at different zoom factors.

 * Since: 1.0
