 * @brief Makes a window visible
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param window The window to make visible.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Maps the specified window. This means making the window visible (as long as its
 * parent is visible).
 * 
 * This MapWindow request will be translated to a MapRequest request if a window
 * manager is running. The window manager then decides to either map the window or
 * not. Set the override-redirect window attribute to true if you want to bypass
 * this mechanism.
 * 
 * If the window manager decides to map the window (or if no window manager is
 * running), a MapNotify event is generated.
 * 
 * If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for it are remembered,
 * the X server tiles the window with its background. If the window&apos;s background
 * is undefined, the existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
 * generates zero or more Expose events.
 * 
 * If the window type is InputOutput, an Expose event will be generated when the
 * window becomes visible. The normal response to an Expose event should be to
 * repaint the window.
 *
 * This form can be used only if the request will not cause
 * a reply to be generated. Any returned error will be
 * saved for handling by xcb_request_check().
