 * @brief Returns the maximum request length that this server accepts.
 * @param c The connection to the X server.
 * @return The maximum request length field.
 *
 * In the absence of the BIG-REQUESTS extension, returns the
 * maximum request length field from the connection setup data, which
 * may be as much as 65535. If the server supports BIG-REQUESTS, then
 * the maximum request length field from the reply to the
 * BigRequestsEnable request will be returned instead.
 *
 * Note that this length is measured in four-byte units, making the
 * theoretical maximum lengths roughly 256kB without BIG-REQUESTS and
 * 16GB with.
