 * @brief Grab keyboard key(s)
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param owner_events If 1, the \a grab_window will still get the pointer events. If 0, events are not
 * reported to the \a grab_window.
 * @param grab_window Specifies the window on which the pointer should be grabbed.
 * @param modifiers The modifiers to grab.
 * \n
 * Using the special value `XCB_MOD_MASK_ANY` means grab the pointer with all
 * possible modifier combinations.
 * @param key The keycode of the key to grab.
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_GRAB_ANY` means grab any key.
 * @param pointer_mode A bitmask of #xcb_grab_mode_t values.
 * @param pointer_mode \n
 * @param keyboard_mode A bitmask of #xcb_grab_mode_t values.
 * @param keyboard_mode \n
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Establishes a passive grab on the keyboard. In the future, the keyboard is
 * actively grabbed (as for `GrabKeyboard`), the last-keyboard-grab time is set to
 * the time at which the key was pressed (as transmitted in the KeyPress event),
 * and the KeyPress event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:
 * 
 * The keyboard is not grabbed and the specified key (which can itself be a
 * modifier key) is logically pressed when the specified modifier keys are
 * logically down, and no other modifier keys are logically down.
 * 
 * Either the grab_window is an ancestor of (or is) the focus window, or the
 * grab_window is a descendant of the focus window and contains the pointer.
 * 
 * A passive grab on the same key combination does not exist on any ancestor of
 * grab_window.
 * 
 * The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for XGrabKeyboard.  The active grab is terminated
 * automatically when the logical state of the keyboard has the specified key released (independent of the
 * logical state of the modifier keys), at which point a KeyRelease event is reported to the grabbing window.
 * 
 * Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications) may lag the physical state if
 * device event processing is frozen.
 * 
 * A modifiers argument of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible modifier combinations (including the combination of no modifiers).  It is not required that all modifiers specified
 * have currently assigned KeyCodes.  A keycode argument of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request for
 * all possible KeyCodes.  Otherwise, the specified keycode must be in the range specified by min_keycode
 * and max_keycode in the connection setup, or a BadValue error results.
 * 
 * If some other client has issued a XGrabKey with the same key combination on the same window, a BadAccess
 * error results.  When using AnyModifier or AnyKey, the request fails completely, and a BadAccess error
 * results (no grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.
