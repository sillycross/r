	 * start drag-and-drop operation
	 *
	 * This request asks the compositor to start a drag-and-drop
	 * operation on behalf of the client.
	 *
	 * The source argument is the data source that provides the data
	 * for the eventual data transfer. If source is NULL, enter, leave
	 * and motion events are sent only to the client that initiated the
	 * drag and the client is expected to handle the data passing
	 * internally.
	 *
	 * The origin surface is the surface where the drag originates and
	 * the client must have an active implicit grab that matches the
	 * serial.
	 *
	 * The icon surface is an optional (can be NULL) surface that
	 * provides an icon to be moved around with the cursor. Initially,
	 * the top-left corner of the icon surface is placed at the cursor
	 * hotspot, but subsequent wl_surface.attach request can move the
	 * relative position. Attach requests must be confirmed with
	 * wl_surface.commit as usual. The icon surface is given the role
	 * of a drag-and-drop icon. If the icon surface already has another
	 * role, it raises a protocol error.
	 *
	 * The current and pending input regions of the icon wl_surface are
	 * cleared, and wl_surface.set_input_region is ignored until the
	 * wl_surface is no longer used as the icon surface. When the use
	 * as an icon ends, the current and pending input regions become
	 * undefined, and the wl_surface is unmapped.
	 * @param source data source for the eventual transfer
	 * @param origin surface where the drag originates
	 * @param icon drag-and-drop icon surface
	 * @param serial serial number of the implicit grab on the origin
