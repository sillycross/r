 * @ingroup iface_wl_output
 * transform from framebuffer to output
 *
 * This describes the transform that a compositor will apply to a
 * surface to compensate for the rotation or mirroring of an
 * output device.
 *
 * The flipped values correspond to an initial flip around a
 * vertical axis followed by rotation.
 *
 * The purpose is mainly to allow clients to render accordingly and
 * tell the compositor, so that for fullscreen surfaces, the
 * compositor will still be able to scan out directly from client
 * surfaces.
