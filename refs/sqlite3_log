** CAPI3REF: Error Logging Interface
**
** ^The [sqlite3_log()] interface writes a message into the [error log]
** established by the [SQLITE_CONFIG_LOG] option to [sqlite3_config()].
** ^If logging is enabled, the zFormat string and subsequent arguments are
** used with [sqlite3_snprintf()] to generate the final output string.
**
** The sqlite3_log() interface is intended for use by extensions such as
** virtual tables, collating functions, and SQL functions.  While there is
** nothing to prevent an application from calling sqlite3_log(), doing so
** is considered bad form.
**
** The zFormat string must not be NULL.
**
** To avoid deadlocks and other threading problems, the sqlite3_log() routine
** will not use dynamically allocated memory.  The log message is stored in
** a fixed-length buffer on the stack.  If the log message is longer than
** a few hundred characters, it will be truncated to the length of the
** buffer.
