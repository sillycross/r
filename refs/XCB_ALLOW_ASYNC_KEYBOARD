frozen as the result of an event having been sent to the client (either from
the activation of a GrabButton or from a previous AllowEvents with mode
SyncPointer but not from a GrabPointer), then the pointer grab is released and
that event is completely reprocessed, this time ignoring any passive grabs at
or above (towards the root) the grab-window of the grab just released. The
request has no effect if the pointer is not grabbed by the client or if the
pointer is not frozen as the result of an event. */</doc>
