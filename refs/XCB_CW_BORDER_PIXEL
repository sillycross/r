same root and the same depth. Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes
may be faster than others.

The special value `XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT` means the parent&apos;s border pixmap is
copied (subsequent changes to the parent&apos;s border attribute do not affect the
child), but the window must have the same depth as the parent. */</doc>
