<doc f='include/gstreamer-1.0/gst/gstcaps.h' l='192'>/**
 * gst_caps_ref:
 * @caps: the #GstCaps to reference
 *
 * Add a reference to a #GstCaps object.
 *
 * From this point on, until the caller calls gst_caps_unref() or
 * gst_caps_make_writable(), it is guaranteed that the caps object will not
 * change. This means its structures won&apos;t change, etc. To use a #GstCaps
 * object, you must always have a refcount on it -- either the one made
 * implicitly by e.g. gst_caps_new_simple(), or via taking one explicitly with
 * this function.
 *
 * Returns: the same #GstCaps object.
