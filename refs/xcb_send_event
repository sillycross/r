 * @brief send an event
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param propagate If \a propagate is true and no clients have selected any event on \a destination,
 * the destination is replaced with the closest ancestor of \a destination for
 * which some client has selected a type in \a event_mask and for which no
 * intervening window has that type in its do-not-propagate-mask. If no such
 * window exists or if the window is an ancestor of the focus window and
 * `InputFocus` was originally specified as the destination, the event is not sent
 * to any clients. Otherwise, the event is reported to every client selecting on
 * the final destination any of the types specified in \a event_mask.
 * @param destination The window to send this event to. Every client which selects any event within
 * \a event_mask on \a destination will get the event.
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_SEND_EVENT_DEST_POINTER_WINDOW` refers to the window
 * that contains the mouse pointer.
 * \n
 * The special value `XCB_SEND_EVENT_DEST_ITEM_FOCUS` refers to the window which
 * has the keyboard focus.
 * @param event_mask Event_mask for determining which clients should receive the specified event.
 * See \a destination and \a propagate.
 * @param event The event to send to the specified \a destination.
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Identifies the \a destination window, determines which clients should receive
 * the specified event and ignores any active grabs.
 * 
 * The \a event must be one of the core events or an event defined by an extension,
 * so that the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as necessary. The
 * contents of \a event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked except for the
 * `send_event` field which is forced to &apos;true&apos;.
