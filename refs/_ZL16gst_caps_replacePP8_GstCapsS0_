 * gst_caps_replace:
 * @old_caps: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a pointer
 *     to a #GstCaps to be replaced.
 * @new_caps: (transfer none) (allow-none): pointer to a #GstCaps that will
 *     replace the caps pointed to by @old_caps.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstCaps to point to a different #GstCaps. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread safety
 * in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately (the old
 * caps is unreffed, the new is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_caps or the #GstCaps pointed to by @old_caps may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_caps was different from @old_caps
