** CAPI3REF: Run-time Limits
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^(This interface allows the size of various constructs to be limited
** on a connection by connection basis.  The first parameter is the
** [database connection] whose limit is to be set or queried.  The
** second parameter is one of the [limit categories] that define a
** class of constructs to be size limited.  The third parameter is the
** new limit for that construct.)^
**
** ^If the new limit is a negative number, the limit is unchanged.
** ^(For each limit category SQLITE_LIMIT_&lt;i&gt;NAME&lt;/i&gt; there is a 
** [limits | hard upper bound]
** set at compile-time by a C preprocessor macro called
** [limits | SQLITE_MAX_&lt;i&gt;NAME&lt;/i&gt;].
** (The &quot;_LIMIT_&quot; in the name is changed to &quot;_MAX_&quot;.))^
** ^Attempts to increase a limit above its hard upper bound are
** silently truncated to the hard upper bound.
**
** ^Regardless of whether or not the limit was changed, the 
** [sqlite3_limit()] interface returns the prior value of the limit.
** ^Hence, to find the current value of a limit without changing it,
** simply invoke this interface with the third parameter set to -1.
**
** Run-time limits are intended for use in applications that manage
** both their own internal database and also databases that are controlled
** by untrusted external sources.  An example application might be a
** web browser that has its own databases for storing history and
** separate databases controlled by JavaScript applications downloaded
** off the Internet.  The internal databases can be given the
** large, default limits.  Databases managed by external sources can
** be given much smaller limits designed to prevent a denial of service
** attack.  Developers might also want to use the [sqlite3_set_authorizer()]
** interface to further control untrusted SQL.  The size of the database
** created by an untrusted script can be contained using the
** [max_page_count] [PRAGMA].
**
** New run-time limit categories may be added in future releases.
