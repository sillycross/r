<doc f='include/xcb/xproto.h' l='2360'>/**&lt; For SyncPointer, if the pointer is frozen and actively grabbed by the client,
pointer event processing continues normally until the next ButtonPress or
ButtonRelease event is reported to the client, at which time the pointer again
appears to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the pointer grab to be
released, then the pointer does not freeze. SyncPointer has no effect if the
pointer is not frozen by the client or if the pointer is not grabbed by the
client. */</doc>
