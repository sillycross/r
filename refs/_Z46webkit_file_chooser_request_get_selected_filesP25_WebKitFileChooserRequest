 * webkit_file_chooser_request_get_selected_files:
 * @request: a #WebKitFileChooserRequest
 *
 * Get the list of selected files currently associated to the
 * request. Initially, the return value of this method contains any
 * files selected in previous file chooser requests for this HTML
 * input element. Once webkit_file_chooser_request_select_files, the
 * value will reflect whatever files are given.
 *
 * This function should normally be called only before presenting the
 * file chooser dialog to the user, to decide whether to perform some
 * extra action, like pre-selecting the files from a previous request.
 *
 * Returns: (array zero-terminated=1) (transfer none): a
 * %NULL-terminated array of strings if there are selected files
 * associated with the request or %NULL otherwise. This array and its
 * contents are owned by WebKit and should not be modified or
 * freed.
