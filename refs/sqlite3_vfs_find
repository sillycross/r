** CAPI3REF: Virtual File System Objects
**
** A virtual filesystem (VFS) is an [sqlite3_vfs] object
** that SQLite uses to interact
** with the underlying operating system.  Most SQLite builds come with a
** single default VFS that is appropriate for the host computer.
** New VFSes can be registered and existing VFSes can be unregistered.
** The following interfaces are provided.
**
** ^The sqlite3_vfs_find() interface returns a pointer to a VFS given its name.
** ^Names are case sensitive.
** ^Names are zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** ^If there is no match, a NULL pointer is returned.
** ^If zVfsName is NULL then the default VFS is returned.
**
** ^New VFSes are registered with sqlite3_vfs_register().
** ^Each new VFS becomes the default VFS if the makeDflt flag is set.
** ^The same VFS can be registered multiple times without injury.
** ^To make an existing VFS into the default VFS, register it again
** with the makeDflt flag set.  If two different VFSes with the
** same name are registered, the behavior is undefined.  If a
** VFS is registered with a name that is NULL or an empty string,
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** ^Unregister a VFS with the sqlite3_vfs_unregister() interface.
** ^(If the default VFS is unregistered, another VFS is chosen as
** the default.  The choice for the new VFS is arbitrary.)^
