 * @ingroup iface_wl_data_device_manager
 * drag and drop actions
 *
 * This is a bitmask of the available/preferred actions in a
 * drag-and-drop operation.
 *
 * In the compositor, the selected action is a result of matching the
 * actions offered by the source and destination sides.  &quot;action&quot; events
 * with a &quot;none&quot; action will be sent to both source and destination if
 * there is no match. All further checks will effectively happen on
 * (source actions âˆ© destination actions).
 *
 * In addition, compositors may also pick different actions in
 * reaction to key modifiers being pressed. One common design that
 * is used in major toolkits (and the behavior recommended for
 * compositors) is:
 *
 * - If no modifiers are pressed, the first match (in bit order)
 * will be used.
 * - Pressing Shift selects &quot;move&quot;, if enabled in the mask.
 * - Pressing Control selects &quot;copy&quot;, if enabled in the mask.
 *
 * Behavior beyond that is considered implementation-dependent.
 * Compositors may for example bind other modifiers (like Alt/Meta)
 * or drags initiated with other buttons than BTN_LEFT to specific
 * actions (e.g. &quot;ask&quot;).
