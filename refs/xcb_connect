 * @brief Connects to the X server.
 * @param displayname The name of the display.
 * @param screenp A pointer to a preferred screen number.
 * @return A newly allocated xcb_connection_t structure.
 *
 * Connects to the X server specified by @p displayname. If @p
 * displayname is @c NULL, uses the value of the DISPLAY environment
 * variable. If a particular screen on that server is preferred, the
 * int pointed to by @p screenp (if not @c NULL) will be set to that
 * screen; otherwise the screen will be set to 0.
 *
 * Always returns a non-NULL pointer to a xcb_connection_t, even on failure.
 * Callers need to use xcb_connection_has_error() to check for failure.
 * When finished, use xcb_disconnect() to close the connection and free
 * the structure.
