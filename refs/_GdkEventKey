 * GdkEventKey:
 * @type: the type of the event (%GDK_KEY_PRESS or %GDK_KEY_RELEASE).
 * @window: the window which received the event.
 * @send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.
 * @time: the time of the event in milliseconds.
 * @state: (type GdkModifierType): a bit-mask representing the state of
 *   the modifier keys (e.g. Control, Shift and Alt) and the pointer
 *   buttons. See #GdkModifierType.
 * @keyval: the key that was pressed or released. See the
 *   `gdk/gdkkeysyms.h` header file for a
 *   complete list of GDK key codes.
 * @length: the length of @string.
 * @string: a string containing an approximation of the text that
 *   would result from this keypress. The only correct way to handle text
 *   input of text is using input methods (see #GtkIMContext), so this
 *   field is deprecated and should never be used.
 *   (gdk_unicode_to_keyval() provides a non-deprecated way of getting
 *   an approximate translation for a key.) The string is encoded in the
 *   encoding of the current locale (Note: this for backwards compatibility:
 *   strings in GTK+ and GDK are typically in UTF-8.) and NUL-terminated.
 *   In some cases, the translation of the key code will be a single
 *   NUL byte, in which case looking at @length is necessary to distinguish
 *   it from the an empty translation.
 * @hardware_keycode: the raw code of the key that was pressed or released.
 * @group: the keyboard group.
 * @is_modifier: a flag that indicates if @hardware_keycode is mapped to a
 *   modifier. Since 2.10
 *
 * Describes a key press or key release event.
