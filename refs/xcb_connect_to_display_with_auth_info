 * @brief Connects to the X server, using an authorization information.
 * @param display The name of the display.
 * @param auth The authorization information.
 * @param screen A pointer to a preferred screen number.
 * @return A newly allocated xcb_connection_t structure.
 *
 * Connects to the X server specified by @p displayname, using the
 * authorization @p auth. If a particular screen on that server is
 * preferred, the int pointed to by @p screenp (if not @c NULL) will
 * be set to that screen; otherwise @p screenp will be set to 0.
 *
 * Always returns a non-NULL pointer to a xcb_connection_t, even on failure.
 * Callers need to use xcb_connection_has_error() to check for failure.
 * When finished, use xcb_disconnect() to close the connection and free
 * the structure.
