 *
 * Indicate that the client can accept the given mime type, or
 * NULL for not accepted.
 *
 * For objects of version 2 or older, this request is used by the
 * client to give feedback whether the client can receive the given
 * mime type, or NULL if none is accepted; the feedback does not
 * determine whether the drag-and-drop operation succeeds or not.
 *
 * For objects of version 3 or newer, this request determines the
 * final result of the drag-and-drop operation. If the end result
 * is that no mime types were accepted, the drag-and-drop operation
 * will be cancelled and the corresponding drag source will receive
 * wl_data_source.cancelled. Clients may still use this event in
 * conjunction with wl_data_source.action for feedback.
