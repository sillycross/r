 * Creates a cursor from a font glyph. X provides a set of standard cursor shapes
 * in a special font named cursor. Applications are encouraged to use this
 * interface for their cursors because the font can be customized for the
 * individual display type.
 * 
 * All pixels which are set to 1 in the source will use the foreground color (as
 * specified by \a fore_red, \a fore_green and \a fore_blue). All pixels set to 0
 * will use the background color (as specified by \a back_red, \a back_green and
 * \a back_blue).
 *
 * This form can be used only if the request will not cause
 * a reply to be generated. Any returned error will be
 * saved for handling by xcb_request_check().
