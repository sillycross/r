 * cairo_extend_t:
 * @CAIRO_EXTEND_NONE: pixels outside of the source pattern
 *   are fully transparent (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_EXTEND_REPEAT: the pattern is tiled by repeating (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_EXTEND_REFLECT: the pattern is tiled by reflecting
 *   at the edges (Since 1.0; but only implemented for surface patterns since 1.6)
 * @CAIRO_EXTEND_PAD: pixels outside of the pattern copy
 *   the closest pixel from the source (Since 1.2; but only
 *   implemented for surface patterns since 1.6)
 *
 * #cairo_extend_t is used to describe how pattern color/alpha will be
 * determined for areas &quot;outside&quot; the pattern&apos;s natural area, (for
 * example, outside the surface bounds or outside the gradient
 * geometry).
 *
 * Mesh patterns are not affected by the extend mode.
 *
 * The default extend mode is %CAIRO_EXTEND_NONE for surface patterns
 * and %CAIRO_EXTEND_PAD for gradient patterns.
 *
 * New entries may be added in future versions.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
