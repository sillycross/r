 * @brief Gets a window property
 *
 * @param c The connection
 * @param _delete Whether the property should actually be deleted. For deleting a property, the
 * specified \a type has to match the actual property type.
 * @param window The window whose property you want to get.
 * @param property The property you want to get (an atom).
 * @param type The type of the property you want to get (an atom).
 * @param long_offset Specifies the offset (in 32-bit multiples) in the specified property where the
 * data is to be retrieved.
 * @param long_length Specifies how many 32-bit multiples of data should be retrieved (e.g. if you
 * set \a long_length to 4, you will receive 16 bytes of data).
 * @return A cookie
 *
 * Gets the specified \a property from the specified \a window. Properties are for
 * example the window title (`WM_NAME`) or its minimum size (`WM_NORMAL_HINTS`).
 * Protocols such as EWMH also use properties - for example EWMH defines the
 * window title, encoded as UTF-8 string, in the `_NET_WM_NAME` property.
