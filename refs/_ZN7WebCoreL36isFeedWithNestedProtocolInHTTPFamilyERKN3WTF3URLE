// feed(|s|search): is considered a &apos;nesting&apos; scheme by embedders that support it, so it can be
// local or remote depending on what is nested. Currently we just check if we are nesting
// http or https, otherwise we ignore the nesting for the purpose of a security check. We need
// a facility for registering nesting schemes, and some generalized logic for them.
// This function should be removed as an outcome of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69196</doc>
