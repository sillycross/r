<doc f='WebKit/Source/JavaScriptCore/b3/air/AirCustom.h' l='40'>// This defines the behavior of custom instructions - i.e. those whose behavior cannot be
// described using AirOpcode.opcodes. If you define an opcode as &quot;custom Foo&quot; in that file, then
// you will need to create a &quot;struct FooCustom&quot; here that implements the custom behavior
// methods.
//
// The customizability granted by the custom instruction mechanism is strictly less than what
// you get using the Patch instruction and implementing a Special. However, that path requires
// allocating a Special object and ensuring that it&apos;s the first operand. For many instructions,
// that is not as convenient as using Custom, which makes the instruction look like any other
// instruction. Note that both of those extra powers of the Patch instruction happen because we
// special-case that instruction in many phases and analyses. Non-special-cased behaviors of
// Patch are implemented using the custom instruction mechanism.
//
// Specials are still more flexible if you need to list extra clobbered registers and you&apos;d like
// that to be expressed as a bitvector rather than an arglist. They are also more flexible if
// you need to carry extra state around with the instruction. Also, Specials mean that you
// always have access to Code&amp; even in methods that don&apos;t take a GenerationContext.

// Definition of Patch instruction. Patch is used to delegate the behavior of the instruction to the
// Special object, which will be the first argument to the instruction.</doc>
