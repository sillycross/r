 * gst_message_replace:
 * @old_message: (inout) (transfer full) (nullable): pointer to a
 *     pointer to a #GstMessage to be replaced.
 * @new_message: (allow-none) (transfer none): pointer to a #GstMessage that will
 *     replace the message pointed to by @old_message.
 *
 * Modifies a pointer to a #GstMessage to point to a different #GstMessage. The
 * modification is done atomically (so this is useful for ensuring thread safety
 * in some cases), and the reference counts are updated appropriately (the old
 * message is unreffed, the new one is reffed).
 *
 * Either @new_message or the #GstMessage pointed to by @old_message may be %NULL.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @new_message was different from @old_message
