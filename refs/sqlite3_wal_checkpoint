** CAPI3REF: Checkpoint a database
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^(The sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) is equivalent to
** [sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2](D,X,[SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE],0,0).)^
**
** In brief, sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(D,X) causes the content in the 
** [write-ahead log] for database X on [database connection] D to be
** transferred into the database file and for the write-ahead log to
** be reset.  See the [checkpointing] documentation for addition
** information.
**
** This interface used to be the only way to cause a checkpoint to
** occur.  But then the newer and more powerful [sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()]
** interface was added.  This interface is retained for backwards
** compatibility and as a convenience for applications that need to manually
** start a callback but which do not need the full power (and corresponding
** complication) of [sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()].
