 * cairo_filter_t:
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_FAST: A high-performance filter, with quality similar
 *     to %CAIRO_FILTER_NEAREST (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_GOOD: A reasonable-performance filter, with quality
 *     similar to %CAIRO_FILTER_BILINEAR (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_BEST: The highest-quality available, performance may
 *     not be suitable for interactive use. (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_NEAREST: Nearest-neighbor filtering (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_BILINEAR: Linear interpolation in two dimensions (Since 1.0)
 * @CAIRO_FILTER_GAUSSIAN: This filter value is currently
 *     unimplemented, and should not be used in current code. (Since 1.0)
 *
 * #cairo_filter_t is used to indicate what filtering should be
 * applied when reading pixel values from patterns. See
 * cairo_pattern_set_filter() for indicating the desired filter to be
 * used with a particular pattern.
