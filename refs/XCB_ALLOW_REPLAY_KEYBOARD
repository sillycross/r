keyboard event processing continues normally until the next KeyPress or
KeyRelease event is reported to the client, at which time the keyboard again
appears to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the keyboard grab to
be released, then the keyboard does not freeze. SyncKeyboard has no effect if
the keyboard is not frozen by the client or if the keyboard is not grabbed by
the client. */</doc>
