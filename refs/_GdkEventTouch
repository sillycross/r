 * GdkEventTouch:
 * @type: the type of the event (%GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN, %GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE,
 *   %GDK_TOUCH_END, %GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL)
 * @window: the window which received the event
 * @send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.
 * @time: the time of the event in milliseconds.
 * @x: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window
 * @y: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window
 * @axes: @x, @y translated to the axes of @device, or %NULL if @device is
 *   the mouse
 * @state: (type GdkModifierType): a bit-mask representing the state of
 *   the modifier keys (e.g. Control, Shift and Alt) and the pointer
 *   buttons. See #GdkModifierType
 * @sequence: the event sequence that the event belongs to
 * @emulating_pointer: whether the event should be used for emulating
 *   pointer event
 * @device: the master device that the event originated from. Use
 * gdk_event_get_source_device() to get the slave device.
 * @x_root: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the
 *   screen
 * @y_root: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the
 *   screen
 *
 * Used for touch events.
 * @type field will be one of %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN, %GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE,
 * %GDK_TOUCH_END or %GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL.
 *
 * Touch events are grouped into sequences by means of the @sequence
 * field, which can also be obtained with gdk_event_get_event_sequence().
 * Each sequence begins with a %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN event, followed by
 * any number of %GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE events, and ends with a %GDK_TOUCH_END
 * (or %GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL) event. With multitouch devices, there may be
 * several active sequences at the same time.
